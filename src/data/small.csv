NCT07005024,DOAC - Dosing Options in AntiCoagulation Prophylaxis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07005024,DOAC,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Blood clots, also known as venous thromboembolism (VTE), are a common and serious complication for people with cancer. They can lead to pain, hospitalizations, delayed cancer treatment, and even death. Although national guidelines recommend using blood thinners (anticoagulants) to prevent clots in cancer patients who are at higher risk, these medications are not commonly prescribed due to concerns about bleeding and inconvenience.

This study will test different ways of using a commonly prescribed blood thinner called apixaban (brand name Eliquis) to see if it can safely and effectively reduce the risk of blood clots and death in cancer patients who are at moderate risk for VTE. The study focuses on people who have a ""Khorana score"" of 2, which puts them at intermediate risk for developing blood clots.

The study will include approximately 996 participants with solid tumors or lymphoma who are starting or recently started cancer-directed therapy. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:

Group 1: Apixaban 2.5 mg twice a day (standard prophylactic dose)

Group 2: Apixaban 5 mg once a day (an alternative, more convenient dose)

Group 3: No anticoagulant (standard care)

Participants will take the assigned treatment (if applicable) for 6 months. Researchers will monitor whether participants develop blood clots, experience serious bleeding events, or die from any cause during the study period.

By comparing these three groups, the researchers hope to learn whether a once-daily dose of apixaban can work as well as the standard twice-daily dose, and whether either dosing strategy is better than no anticoagulation at all. If successful, the study may help increase the safe use of VTE prevention in cancer patients and improve overall outcomes, especially in patients at intermediate risk.

This is a pragmatic trial, meaning it is designed to fit into real-world clinical practice with minimal extra procedures.

NCT07005011,Comparison of the Efficacy of Oral Irrigator Versus Interdental Brushes in the Oral Hygiene of Patients With Gingivitis: a Randomised Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07005011,Hydro-Paro,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Periodontal health is a public health issue because of the frequency of periodontal disease (more than 50% of the French population suffers from severe periodontitis (Bourgeois, Bouchard and Mattout 2007)), its negative impact on patients' quality of life, speech, self-confidence and well-being, and its association with the development of chronic pathologies (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease).

Gingivitis is a reversible inflammatory disease of the superficial tissues supporting the teeth. If left untreated, this inflammation will become chronic and spread apically to the deep tissues supporting the tooth, evolving into periodontitis with irreversible damage. The aetiopathogenic phenomena that lead to the onset of periodontal disease are complex, but one of the main aetiopathogenic factors is the bacterial biofilm found in the form of dental plaque.

Maintaining correct oral hygiene remains the main means of preventing periodontal disease (Chapple et al. 2018). Plaque control is achieved by the dental surgeon through scaling and resurfacing at intervals appropriate to the patient, but also by the patient themselves. Mechanical removal of plaque by brushing prevents it from accumulating and prevents the onset of these diseases. This control by the patient is essential to the effectiveness of periodontal treatments and the maintenance of periodontal health.

Plaque control by the patient using a toothbrush is not sufficient and must be supplemented by the use of interdental hygiene (Lindhe and Koch 1967). To date, the most effective interdental hygiene tools for reducing gingival inflammation and the plaque index are interdental brushes (Sälzer et al. 2015). However, their effectiveness requires professional calibration to enable adaptation to all sites, which can then reduce patient compliance through the need to use multiple tools.

Oral irrigator were developed in the 1960s and in 2001 the American Academy of Periodontology recognised their value in reducing gingival inflammation. The oral irrigator Sonicare HX8432 Ultra, Philips® was developed recently, combining water and air. Its pulsatile action is considered to be more conservative of gingival soft tissue and qualitatively modifies the composition of dental plaque.

The advantage of this tool is that, unlike interdental brushes, it does not require calibration and is simpler to use.",NO,Gingivitis,OTHER: oral irrigator,"Approximal plaque index (API - Lange, 1977), API is the number of interdental spaces covered by plaque divided by the total number of interdental spaces studied, expressed as a percentage.

NCT07004959,Non-inferiority Trial Comparing Vaginal Ultrasound-guided Ethanol Sclerotherapy and Laparoscopic Cystectomy for the Management of Ovarian Endometriomas (E-STEP),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004959,E-STEP,RECRUITING,"Endometriosis is a disease that affects between 6 and 10% of women of childbearing age. It is defined by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, most often in the ovaries or the peritoneal cavity.

The standard treatment for endometriomas is laparoscopic intraperitoneal cystectomy. This treatment has been shown to be associated with a lower rate of recurrence of painful symptoms than simple cyst drainage, and with higher pregnancy rates. Nevertheless, cystectomy can lead to a reduction in ovarian reserve due to the removal of adjacent healthy ovarian tissue, particularly when there is no cleavage plane between the ovary and the endometrioma.

Other methods have been developed to manage endometriomas while preserving the ovarian reserve. Endometrioma sclerotherapy is one of the most promising techniques for reducing the risk of recurrence while preserving the ovarian reserve. This technique involves injecting a sclerosing agent into the cystic cavity, which has been drained beforehand, in order to create an abrasion of the cystic epithelium, resulting in inflammation and fibrosis that can lead to the permanent destruction of the cyst.

The aim of the study is to conduct a single-centre randomised controlled non-inferiority trial comparing sclerotherapy and intraperitoneal cystectomy for the treatment of endometriomas.

The main hypothesis of the study is that sclerotherapy is not inferior to cystectomy in terms of reducing painful symptoms one year after the operation and that it is superior to cystectomy on one or more of the following criteria: preservation of ovarian reserve, operative complications, post-operative pain, patient acceptability/satisfaction.

NCT07004920,Adaptation and Validation of a Patient-centered Outcome Scale for People in the Intensive Care Unit (IPOS-ICU),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004920,IPOS-ICU,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The focus of intensive care is on survival and the prolongation of life. The care of organ systems takes priority and is assessed through screening tools such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, which evaluates clinical and laboratory factors associated with prognosis. Despite advancements in modern intensive care, the hospital mortality rate for mechanically ventilated patients in 2022 was approximately 43%. Even for survivors of intensive care, post-intensive care syndrome poses a significant burden on quality of life.

Although intensive care and palliative care often appear to be contradictory, clinical overlap between these populations is common, with both experiencing physical, psychosocial, and spiritual challenges that frequently require input from specialized teams. Nevertheless, palliative care remains underrepresented in German intensive care units (ICUs), with only 1.4% of ICU patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation receiving specialist palliative care. Therefore, the identification of patients in need of palliative care and the reduction of barriers such as limited resources and varying clinician attitudes must be addressed. This necessitates a robust tool for measuring and assessing palliative care needs specifically in ICU patients, enabling the implementation of interventions aimed at minimizing the burden on patients, families, and treating clinicians, as well as guiding appropriate allocation of healthcare resources.

The Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (IPOS) questionnaire was developed as a patient-centered measurement instrument from a palliative care perspective. IPOS enables the assessment of symptoms and needs from the viewpoint of patients and their families. For patients with COVID-19, an adapted version-IPOS-COV-was developed, wherein healthcare personnel assess patient symptoms and needs. However, no existing instrument comprehensively captures the physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs of ICU patients and their families from a palliative care perspective. Such a tool could facilitate both the identification of patients requiring palliative care and serve as an endpoint for evaluating the effectiveness of palliative care interventions in ICU settings, including post-discharge outcomes related to post-intensive care syndrome affecting both patients and families.

The underlying hypothesis is that a patient-centered measurement instrument addressing physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs from a palliative care perspective for ICU patients can be developed and validated based on the IPOS. Additionally, demographic data, clinical course, ICU interventions (e.g., mechanical ventilation, dialysis, palliative care consultations, family discussions, and therapy goal limitations), as well as SOFA scores and Palliative Phase of Illness (PPoI) classifications at the time of IPOS-ICU assessment, will be collected. It is hypothesized that IPOS-ICU scores will correlate with disease severity (as measured by SOFA and PPoI) and poor ICU outcomes, including length of stay, mortality, and discharge location. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that interventions such as palliative care consultations will be associated with lower IPOS-ICU scores. In the first phase of the study, an international and multiprofessional expert panel with experience in both intensive and palliative care will adapt the IPOS questionnaire for ICU patients, resulting in the development of the IPOS-ICU. The following modification strategies will be applied: rewording, removal, addition of items, adjustment of recall periods, and inclusion of a ""cannot assess"" response option. Online meetings will be conducted with representatives from Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, and the United States. A larger review team will then evaluate the adapted version, and an informal ""comfort consultation"" will be conducted in ICU settings to ensure that the IPOS-ICU is considered appropriate and acceptable by ICU staff. Following adaptation, the validation phase will be conducted using a multicenter design. After obtaining informed consent from study participants, the IPOS-ICU will be administered at designated time points identified during the adaptation process. ICU staff (including at least one nursing professional and one medical professional) will complete the IPOS-ICU. The questionnaire will include an assessment of the PPoI (categorized as stable, unstable, deteriorating, dying, or deceased), and a free-text field for recording the estimated number of hours spent with the patient.

Despite recent advances, it remains a major health issue due to late-stage diagnosis and high patient and societal burden. New insights into tumor and immune pathways have led to the development of targeted therapies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and therapeutic antibodies. Among these, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and durvalumab have significantly improved outcomes for some patients by reactivating T-cell responses.

The LCAb (Lung Cancer Antibodies) research project focuses on studying the interindividual variability of clinical response to ICI in lung cancer. These therapies are now used across various lung cancer types and stages, including early and advanced disease.

NCT07004699,"Comparison of Two Ventilation Methods During Endoscopy of the Pharynx, Larynx and Oesophagus",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004699,OPTIGO,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Around 15,000 ENT cancers are diagnosed each year in France. The majority of these cancers will at one time or another require an Endoscopy of the Pharynx, Larynx and Esophagus (Endo-PLE or suspension laryngoscopy). Endoscopies of the Otorhinolaryngeal (ENT) sphere are common procedures. They consist of inserting a rigid laryngoscope through the mouth, allowing full exposure of the laryngeal sphere. They are performed in most cases as part of a swelling assessment, following CT scans, or following the discovery of a mass upon palpation of the patient. Unfortunately, these are aggressive cancers that subsequently require major surgery and additional treatment by radio or chemotherapy. This examination can also be performed on patients suffering from swallowing disorders, following the appearance of polyps, and this time not requiring an adjuvant to surgery but their removal. For all patients, these endo-PLE are performed in the operating room and require general anesthesia. This surgical procedure is now performed by performing two laryngoscopies. The first is used to maintain good pulmonary oxygenation by introducing an oxygen cannula, the second constitutes the surgical procedure itself. The oxygen cannula is placed through the nasal cavity, directly up to the entrance of the vocal cords. This procedure is not without risk both for the patient (risk of dental breakage and bleeding during laryngoscopy) but also for the surgeon, because the cannula itself can obstruct his vision. It would be possible to do without one of them by setting up high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT). This device has been widely deployed in continuous care and intensive care units, but is not yet the subject of much research in surgical units. The HFOT consists of oxygen cannulae delivering a mixture of gases at a high flow rate ranging from 20 to 70 liters per minute. The investigator want to evaluate through this study, the feasibility and effectiveness of setting up HFOT during procedures.

NCT07004686,Effect of MGRNOX Index-Guided General Anesthesia on Opioid Consumption in Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004686,,RECRUITING,"1. Pain management is a crucial part of general anesthesia surgery. Nociception monitoring can help anesthesiologists better titrate the use of intraoperative analgesic drugs, especially the opioid.
2. Although a variety of nociception monitoring devices have been developed to date, there is not a specific monitoring indicator that serves as the ""gold standard"" to objectively guide analgesic management in general anesthesia.
3. The MGRNOX index, which is derived from electroencephalogram (EEG), is used to reflect the correlation between noxious stimuli and opioid analgesics in a state of general anesthesia by converting and quantifying the EEG signals collected by the instrument. However, no studies have so far verified the effect of the MGRNOX index-guided analgesic management of general anesthesia on the consumption of opioids in patients.

Aalana Palana draws from the Nurturing Care Framework that provides guidance on giving children the best start in their lives.

Aalana Palana was developed through extensive community engagement, using culturally relevant and locally adaptable video content. This participatory approach ensured its acceptability and contributed to its success in addressing critical gaps in child growth and development. It was delivered entirely within the existing Integrated Child Development Scheme which ensured its sustainability. The innovative use of facilitated video-viewing allowed for standardized delivery of evidence-based practices, around optimal nutrition and parenting during the first 1000 days, reducing the burden on frontline workers while improving caregiver engagement and comprehension.

This intervention was used by Anganwadi workers to conduct group and individual counselling sessions with caregivers in their communities. Aalana Palana implemented a transition from traditional paper-based counselling sessions to a video-based, discussion and demonstration led counselling model. Age specific videos promoted responsive and sensitive parenting, early learning opportunities for children \& include desired nutritional practices for young children \& pregnant women. The content not only describes 'WHAT' behaviours caregiver should adopt, 'HOW' they could include these behaviours in their routines but also 'WHY' a particular behaviour is important for their child's development.

A key strength of this study is its policy relevance. Aalana Palana has been incorporated into the ICDS guidelines for Supplementary Nutrition Program in Telangana, providing a blueprint for scaling similar programs across the country and in other LMICs.",NO,Child Development|Child Nutrition and Early Child Development,BEHAVIORAL: Aalana Palana,"Caregiver Reported Early Development Instruments (CREDI), A caregiver-reported population-level measure of early childhood development for children aged 0-36 months, was used to assess child development through easily observable milestones and behaviours, focusing on developmental progress.

A comprehensive patient assessment, including evaluations of frailty and sarcopenia, could optimize care by identifying those at risk for poor outcomes or poor treatment tolerance. Frailty, characterized by reduced physiological reserves, and sarcopenia, defined as a loss of muscle mass and strength, are both associated with increased mortality and morbidity risks.

NCT07004569,Angiolite Registry Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004569,,RECRUITING,"Left main coronary artery (LMCA) is a major branch of coronary artery and supplies a large bulk of myocardium. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using contemporary drug eluting stent (DES) is one of the treatment options for patients with significant LMCA disease and suitable anatomy as multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of PCI in the treatment of LMCA disease. There are a few challenges in LMCA PCI due to certain anatomical and structural factors. The LMCA disease frequently involves bifurcations which requires special considerations such as side-branch access and preservation in order to prevent procedural related myocardial infarction (MI). Implantation of a metallic scaffold across the LMCA bifurcation often requires aggressive post-dilatation of the LMCA stent due to the diameter discrepancy between the side-branch and the LMCA main body. However, overexpansion beyond the rated diameter might compromise the stent integrity and radial force, resulting in mal-apposition, vascular recoil and risk of subsequent target lesion failure (TLF). The Angiolite stent is a thin-strut cobalt-chromium sirolimus-eluting stent with an open-cell design and a high overexpansion capacity that might overcomes some of these challenges in LMCA PCI. The ANGIOLITE randomized trial confirmed the non-inferiority of the Angiolite stent against the conventional DES. However, patients with LMCA involvement were specifically excluded from the trial.

NCT07004270,Evaluation of the Impact of Emergency Advanced Practice Nurses One Year After Implementation in the Adult Emergency Department of a French University Hospital - A Monocentric Cross-sectional Observational Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004270,IMPACTED,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"In France and around the world, emergency care facilities are facing increasing demand, with rising waiting times. Differentiating care pathways, notably by opening a fast-track unit, helps to improve patient flow and waiting time; which contributes to patient satisfaction. However, a link between patient satisfaction and waiting time is not always found when patients perceive a humanistic approach in care.

The implementation of an advanced practice nurse in an emergency department is a way to graduate the offer of care and reduce waiting times before consultation and length of stay for patients with minor degree of severity. In this care context, Advanced Practice Nurses maintain and even improve patient satisfaction.

Since July 2024, two Advanced Practice Nurses have integrated Poitiers University Hospital's adult emergency department. Considering the existing and ongoing literature to our knowledge, an evaluation of the impact of emergency Advanced Practice Nurses 1 year after their implementation in a French University Hospital would be the first study of its kind.

According to the results of previous international studies, we assume that emergency Advanced Practice Nurses activities have a positive impact on the French healthcare system: on the quality of care perceived by patients and on the emergency care pathways of all fast-track patients by maintaining the same level of safety. We aim to evaluate the impact of emergency Advanced Practice Nurses in a French University Hospital on patient perception of quality of care, safety and patient care pathways in emergency departments.

Our monocentric cross-sectional observational study is a prospective survey of patient satisfaction and experience with a satisfaction questionnaire; and a retrospective survey on routine care data.

Our main objective is to evaluate the impact of emergency Advanced Practice Nurses in a French University Hospital on patient-perceived quality of care by measuring the overall satisfaction of patients who receive care from Advanced Practice Nurses during their emergency care pathway. Overall patient satisfaction will be measured in a survey conducted with a patient satisfaction and experience questionnaire.

Our secondary objectives are several:

* Assess patients' acceptability of being cared by an emergency Advanced Practice Nurse
* Evaluate patient satisfaction with the communication and care relationship with an emergency Advanced Practice Nurse
* Evaluate the rate of recommendation of an emergency Advanced Practice Nurse by the patients who receive care from an Advanced Practice Nurse
* Evaluate the safety of care pathways including an emergency Advanced Practice Nurse
* Evaluate the impact of emergency Advanced Practice Nurses implementation on emergency care pathways for fast-track patients

Consistent with each objective and outcome, we will compare:

* groups before and after the implementation of emergency Advanced Practice Nurses
* or subgroups in the period after implementation of advanced practice nurses: with and without emergency Advanced Practice Nurses intervention The anonymous patient satisfaction and experience survey will be sent by a link in a verified e-mail during the emergency department visit of patients included in the study, admitted to emergency department between 02/06/2025 and 29/06/2025.

Routine care data will be collected from Poitiers hospital medical records for fast-track patients who did not refuse to take part in the study during the following periods:

* Before Advanced Practice Nurses' implementation from 05/27/2024 to 06/23/2024

NCT07004088,The Effect of Mandala Coloring on Symptom Burden and Self-Care in Female Dialysis Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004088,mandala and HD,COMPLETED,"In kidney patients, especially the continuous dialysis treatment can cause symptoms which adversely affect patients' self-care abilities and quality of life. T Nonpharmacological methods can be used to reduce low and moderate symptoms. Mandala is one of the non-pharmacological approaches and is used in many areas with its therapeutic properties.

In the literature review on the effect of mandala application on dialysis patients symptoms and self care, no research was found. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of mandala coloring on dialysis symptoms and self-care of female patients receiving hemodialysis treatment.

Data were collected by using personal information form, Dialysis Symptom Index Scale, Self-Care Power Scale for Chronic Dialysis Patients.

As an intervention tool, a circular mandala and 12 felt paint were used in the study.

Study was designed as a randomized control study Intervention Group; voluntary consent form, personal information form, ""Dialysis Symptom Index Scale"", ""Self-Care Power Scale for Chronic Dialysis Patients"" were filled. One hour after the start of each dialysis session, the patients were given mandalas for 20-30 minutes and asked to paint. After the sixth dialysis session , the patients were asked to refill the scales with one-on-one interviews, and the verbal opinions and feedback of the patients about the application were taken.

Control Group; Female patients undergoing dialysis treatment in the dialysis unit were informed about the study.

(2005) to determine the symptoms experienced by HD patients and the level of impact on patients. The Turkish reliability and validity of the scale was made by Önsöz and Yeşilbalkan (2013) and Cronbach's alpha value was reported as 0.84. DSI identifies 30 symptoms, either physical or emotional. In DSI, the symptoms experienced in the last week are answered as yes-no, and if the answer is yes, the extent to which the symptoms affected the patients who answered ""yes"" was evaluated as 0 = no, 1 = none, 2 = some, 3 = sometimes, 4 = very little, 5 = too much. The total scale score is obtained by adding the obtained scores. The score of the scale ranges from 0-150. The fact that the answers given to the scale increased towards 150 points indicates that the effect of the symptom in question increased. The internal consistency coefficient of the scale was determined as 0.84 (Usta, 2013)., After voluntary consent is obtained, the scale filled in by interviewing the patients one-on-one before the mandala painting attempt begins. 4 weeks after the completion of the mandala colouring the scale replenished|Self-Care Agency Scale for Patients on Long-Term Dialysis, The scale was developed by Besey Ören in 2010 for HD and peritoneal dialysis patients. The Self-Care Agency Scale is an easily understandable, 22-item, 3-point Likert-type scale. The items are scored as follows: 0=I always apply, 1=I sometimes apply, and 2=I do not apply at all. It was created for people to express their status of applying selfcare habits in their daily lives. The patient is asked to choose the most appropriate option for him. The total score obtainable from the tool ranges between 0 and 44. Subscale scores are obtained by summing the item scores under each subscale. Accordingly, scores obtainable from the subscales are 0-12 for the use of medicine, 0-10 for diet, 0-8 for self-monitoring, 0-4 for hygienic care, and 0-6 for mental state. It shows that as the score obtained from the scale decreases, self-care ability decreases.16 The α coefficient of the scale was 0.67., After voluntary consent is obtained, the scale filled in by interviewing the patients one-on-one before the mandala painting attempt begins. 4 weeks after the completion of the mandala colouring the scale replenished",,,Atlas University,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,82,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE,29.05.2024/03.06.2024,2024-09-10,2025-01-30,2025-01-30,2025-06-04,,2025-06-04,"Dialysis Center, Istanbul, Turkey",

Parents are asked to rate the frequency of responses in their children to 125 common experiences using a Likert scale format. These questions and responses are divided into eight categories: Auditory, Visual, Activity Level, Taste/Smell, Body Position, Movement, Touch, and Emotional/Social. The sensory profile was deemed appropriate for children ages 3-10 and was standardized on 1,200 children with and without disabilities. Content and construct validity have been established. Responses are summarized in six sensory processing domains (Auditory Processing, Visual Processing, Vestibular Processing, Tactile Processing, Multisensory Processing, Oral Sensory Processing), five modulation processes, and three behavioral and emotional responses domains. The validity and reliability studies of the scale in Turkish., Both assessments will take 15 minutes each, one at the beginning of the study, the day before the intervention, and one at the end of the study, the day after the intervention.|Executive Function/Self Regulation, The scale consists of 3 levels of applications. At the first level, the child is asked to touch his feet when he is told to ""touch his head"" and to touch his head when he is told to ""touch his feet"". If he is successful at this level, he is asked to touch his shoulders when he is told to ""touch his knee"" and to touch his knees when he is told to ""touch his shoulder"". If he is successful at this level, he is asked to touch his knees when he is told to ""touch his head"", to touch his shoulders when he is told to ""touch his feet"", to touch his feet when he is told to ""touch his shoulder"" and to touch his head when he is told to ""touch his knees"". If he can do the given command without any mistakes, he is given 2 points, if he is oriented towards the wrong and does it correctly, he is given 1 point and if he gives the wrong answer, he is given 0 points. A total score of 0-60 is given with 10 applications at each level. As the score increases, the self-regulation score will increase., Both assessments will take 30 minutes each, one at the beginning of the study, the day before the intervention, and one at the end of the study, the day after the intervention.|Occupational Performance, The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is a general questionnaire based on a semistructured interview. The semistructured design allows individuals to identify important occupations that they have difficulty performing. COPM is derived from the Canadian Activity Performance Model, which defines occupational performance as the ability to organize, select, and perform meaningful occupations that are culturally defined and age-appropriate for taking care of oneself, enjoying life, building the economic fabric of society, and contributing to the social world. The fifth version of the COPM was published in 2014 and its Turkish adaptation has been made., Both assessments will take 10 minutes each, one at the beginning of the study, the day before the intervention, and one at the end of the study, the day after the intervention.|Problematic Media Use, It was developed to determine problematic media use in children between the ages of 4 and 11. The items of the scale were created by taking into account the Internet Gaming Disorder criteria expressed in DSM V. The scale consists of a 27-item form. The scale is Likert-type and each item is scored between 1 (never) and 5 (always). The total score obtained from the Problematic Media Use Scale is calculated by averaging the scores obtained from all items. High scores obtained from the scale indicate problematic use. While the scale, which is filled out by parents considering the child's behavior, does not provide information on the problematic use of a specific media tool, it tries to determine the problematic use of visual media tools (such as phones, tablets, computers, televisions) in general, in other words, screen addiction., Both assessments will take 5 minutes each, one at the beginning of the study, the day before the intervention, and one at the end of the study, the day after the intervention.|Occupational Profile, This assessment tool comprises 25 items organized into six sections. The initial five sections (volition, habituation, communication \& interaction skills, process skills, motor skills) evaluate the child's personal attributes and their influence on participation and performance in various activities. The final section investigates the impact of the environment on the child's capacity to engage in and perform these activities.

A four-point ordinal scale is employed for scoring individual items, using the following codes:

F = Facilitates A = Allows I = Inhibits R = Restricts participation

Numerical values are assigned to each code, ranging from 4 to 0. Specifically, 'F' is assigned a value of 4, 'A' is 3, 'I' is 2, and 'R' is 1.

The item scores are summed, yielding a maximum total score of 100 for the entire assessment.

Unit of Measure: Percentage of participants (%), Week 5","Reduction in HIV-Related Stigma (Survey Score Change), HIV-related stigma will be measured using an adapted multi-item stigma scale (e.g., internalized and anticipated stigma). Change from pre- to post-intervention will be reported. Scores will be reported as mean change from pre- to post-intervention. The scale ranges from 1 (low stigma) to 5 (high stigma). Lower scores indicate a reduction in stigma (better outcome).

Unit of Measure: Mean change in stigma score, Baseline to Week 8|Number of Participants Reporting the WhatsApp-Based Intervention is Sustainable and Scalable, Assessed qualitatively via thematic analysis of exit interviews. Participants will be asked if the WhatsApp format and intervention content could be maintained and scaled in their community. Themes will be summarized narratively.

Unit of Measure: Not applicable - qualitative outcome, Week 6-8 (exit interviews)|Perceived Appropriateness of the Intervention (IAM Score), Appropriateness of the intervention will be measured using the Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), a validated 4-item scale with 5-point Likert responses. Scores range from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). Higher scores indicate greater perceived appropriateness. Results will be reported as mean and standard deviation.

NCT07003776,Evaluation of Tumor Budding In Colorectal Adenocarcinoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07003776,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most prevalent cancers globally, with approximately one to two million new cases diagnosed each year. This makes CRC the third most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with 700,000 deaths per year, exceeded only by lung, liver and stomach cancers. CRC accounts for about 10% of all cancer diagnoses worldwide (Sung et al., 2021; Masetti et al., 2022) .

CRC affects different races and ethnicities at various age groups in distinct ways. Among patients younger than 50 years old, the proportion of CRC is nearly double for Black individuals (16%) compared to White individuals (9%) and Hispanic individuals (6%). In Egypt, CRC ranked the seventh among cancers, following lung, breast, prostate, liver, and bladder cancers (Mounir et al., 2022).

Tumor budding (TB) is characterized by the presence of individual tumor cells or small clusters of up to four cells at the invasive margin of a tumor. This histological feature, which indicates the separation of malignant cells from the main tumor mass, has intrigued pathologists since it was first identified in the 1950s (Giordano et al., 2024).

Evaluating TB is crucial for improving prognostic accuracy and informing treatment decisions. Tumors with high-grade TB exhibit a significantly lower 5-year Disease-Free Survival (DFS) rate compared to those with low-grade TB. High-grade TB is regarded as a negative prognostic factor and is associated with an increased risk of recurrence (Kyong Shin et al., 2023).

TB can be observed in conventional slides when prominent, but careful observation is necessary. A more thorough assessment of TB is more easily achieved if the neoplastic epithelium is highlighted using pan-cytokeratin immunostains (Mishra et al., 2022).

Pan-keratin (Pan-CK) antibodies are proteins derived from cytoskeletal intermediate filaments. These antibodies are a mixture designed to detect multiple low and high molecular weight keratins. Their primary purpose is to allow for the immunohistochemical identification of all epithelial cell types, regardless of their tissue of origin, using a single diagnostic tool.

In surgical pathology, Pan-CK antibodies are commonly used to confirm the epithelial origin of both neoplastic (tumorous) and non-neoplastic tissues, as well as to identify small metastases in lymph nodes. However, there are limitations to the assumption that Pan-CK antibodies will stain all epithelial tumors and that non-epithelial tissues will be ""keratin negative."" It has been reported that a diverse range of epithelial tumors can be Pan-CK negative, challenging the notion that these antibodies are universally applicable (Wick et al., 1986; Badzio, 2019).

Pan-CK can help diagnose disease like breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. It is often used in conjunction with other antibodies for these specific cancers (Chu and Weiss, 2002).",NO,Colorectal Adenocarcinoma,OTHER: Biological: Immunohistochemical staining,"Evaluation of Tumor Budding in Colorectal Adenocarcinoma, Histological assessment and immunohistochemical highlighting of tumor Budding by Pan-CK., 6 months","Correlation of Tumor Budding with clinicopathological parameters, Correlation between different grades of Tumor Budding in Colorectal Carcinoma cells and some clinical and pathological parameters as age, sex, tumor phenotype and nodal status., 6 months",,Sohag University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,50,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,Soh-Med--25-5-2MS,2025-10-01,2026-05-03,2026-05-03,2025-06-04,,2025-06-04,,
