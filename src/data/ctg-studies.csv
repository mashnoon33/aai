NCT07005024,DOAC - Dosing Options in AntiCoagulation Prophylaxis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07005024,DOAC,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Blood clots, also known as venous thromboembolism (VTE), are a common and serious complication for people with cancer. They can lead to pain, hospitalizations, delayed cancer treatment, and even death. Although national guidelines recommend using blood thinners (anticoagulants) to prevent clots in cancer patients who are at higher risk, these medications are not commonly prescribed due to concerns about bleeding and inconvenience.

This study will test different ways of using a commonly prescribed blood thinner called apixaban (brand name Eliquis) to see if it can safely and effectively reduce the risk of blood clots and death in cancer patients who are at moderate risk for VTE. The study focuses on people who have a ""Khorana score"" of 2, which puts them at intermediate risk for developing blood clots.

The study will include approximately 996 participants with solid tumors or lymphoma who are starting or recently started cancer-directed therapy. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:

Group 1: Apixaban 2.5 mg twice a day (standard prophylactic dose)

Group 2: Apixaban 5 mg once a day (an alternative, more convenient dose)

Group 3: No anticoagulant (standard care)

Participants will take the assigned treatment (if applicable) for 6 months. Researchers will monitor whether participants develop blood clots, experience serious bleeding events, or die from any cause during the study period.

By comparing these three groups, the researchers hope to learn whether a once-daily dose of apixaban can work as well as the standard twice-daily dose, and whether either dosing strategy is better than no anticoagulation at all. If successful, the study may help increase the safe use of VTE prevention in cancer patients and improve overall outcomes, especially in patients at intermediate risk.

This is a pragmatic trial, meaning it is designed to fit into real-world clinical practice with minimal extra procedures.

NCT07005011,Comparison of the Efficacy of Oral Irrigator Versus Interdental Brushes in the Oral Hygiene of Patients With Gingivitis: a Randomised Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07005011,Hydro-Paro,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Periodontal health is a public health issue because of the frequency of periodontal disease (more than 50% of the French population suffers from severe periodontitis (Bourgeois, Bouchard and Mattout 2007)), its negative impact on patients' quality of life, speech, self-confidence and well-being, and its association with the development of chronic pathologies (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease).

Gingivitis is a reversible inflammatory disease of the superficial tissues supporting the teeth. If left untreated, this inflammation will become chronic and spread apically to the deep tissues supporting the tooth, evolving into periodontitis with irreversible damage. The aetiopathogenic phenomena that lead to the onset of periodontal disease are complex, but one of the main aetiopathogenic factors is the bacterial biofilm found in the form of dental plaque.

Maintaining correct oral hygiene remains the main means of preventing periodontal disease (Chapple et al. 2018). Plaque control is achieved by the dental surgeon through scaling and resurfacing at intervals appropriate to the patient, but also by the patient themselves. Mechanical removal of plaque by brushing prevents it from accumulating and prevents the onset of these diseases. This control by the patient is essential to the effectiveness of periodontal treatments and the maintenance of periodontal health.

Plaque control by the patient using a toothbrush is not sufficient and must be supplemented by the use of interdental hygiene (Lindhe and Koch 1967). To date, the most effective interdental hygiene tools for reducing gingival inflammation and the plaque index are interdental brushes (Sälzer et al. 2015). However, their effectiveness requires professional calibration to enable adaptation to all sites, which can then reduce patient compliance through the need to use multiple tools.

Oral irrigator were developed in the 1960s and in 2001 the American Academy of Periodontology recognised their value in reducing gingival inflammation. The oral irrigator Sonicare HX8432 Ultra, Philips® was developed recently, combining water and air. Its pulsatile action is considered to be more conservative of gingival soft tissue and qualitatively modifies the composition of dental plaque.

The advantage of this tool is that, unlike interdental brushes, it does not require calibration and is simpler to use.",NO,Gingivitis,OTHER: oral irrigator,"Approximal plaque index (API - Lange, 1977), API is the number of interdental spaces covered by plaque divided by the total number of interdental spaces studied, expressed as a percentage.

NCT07004959,Non-inferiority Trial Comparing Vaginal Ultrasound-guided Ethanol Sclerotherapy and Laparoscopic Cystectomy for the Management of Ovarian Endometriomas (E-STEP),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004959,E-STEP,RECRUITING,"Endometriosis is a disease that affects between 6 and 10% of women of childbearing age. It is defined by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, most often in the ovaries or the peritoneal cavity.

The standard treatment for endometriomas is laparoscopic intraperitoneal cystectomy. This treatment has been shown to be associated with a lower rate of recurrence of painful symptoms than simple cyst drainage, and with higher pregnancy rates. Nevertheless, cystectomy can lead to a reduction in ovarian reserve due to the removal of adjacent healthy ovarian tissue, particularly when there is no cleavage plane between the ovary and the endometrioma.

Other methods have been developed to manage endometriomas while preserving the ovarian reserve. Endometrioma sclerotherapy is one of the most promising techniques for reducing the risk of recurrence while preserving the ovarian reserve. This technique involves injecting a sclerosing agent into the cystic cavity, which has been drained beforehand, in order to create an abrasion of the cystic epithelium, resulting in inflammation and fibrosis that can lead to the permanent destruction of the cyst.

The aim of the study is to conduct a single-centre randomised controlled non-inferiority trial comparing sclerotherapy and intraperitoneal cystectomy for the treatment of endometriomas.

The main hypothesis of the study is that sclerotherapy is not inferior to cystectomy in terms of reducing painful symptoms one year after the operation and that it is superior to cystectomy on one or more of the following criteria: preservation of ovarian reserve, operative complications, post-operative pain, patient acceptability/satisfaction.

NCT07004920,Adaptation and Validation of a Patient-centered Outcome Scale for People in the Intensive Care Unit (IPOS-ICU),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004920,IPOS-ICU,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The focus of intensive care is on survival and the prolongation of life. The care of organ systems takes priority and is assessed through screening tools such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, which evaluates clinical and laboratory factors associated with prognosis. Despite advancements in modern intensive care, the hospital mortality rate for mechanically ventilated patients in 2022 was approximately 43%. Even for survivors of intensive care, post-intensive care syndrome poses a significant burden on quality of life.

Although intensive care and palliative care often appear to be contradictory, clinical overlap between these populations is common, with both experiencing physical, psychosocial, and spiritual challenges that frequently require input from specialized teams. Nevertheless, palliative care remains underrepresented in German intensive care units (ICUs), with only 1.4% of ICU patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation receiving specialist palliative care. Therefore, the identification of patients in need of palliative care and the reduction of barriers such as limited resources and varying clinician attitudes must be addressed. This necessitates a robust tool for measuring and assessing palliative care needs specifically in ICU patients, enabling the implementation of interventions aimed at minimizing the burden on patients, families, and treating clinicians, as well as guiding appropriate allocation of healthcare resources.

The Integrated Palliative Care Outcome Scale (IPOS) questionnaire was developed as a patient-centered measurement instrument from a palliative care perspective. IPOS enables the assessment of symptoms and needs from the viewpoint of patients and their families. For patients with COVID-19, an adapted version-IPOS-COV-was developed, wherein healthcare personnel assess patient symptoms and needs. However, no existing instrument comprehensively captures the physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs of ICU patients and their families from a palliative care perspective. Such a tool could facilitate both the identification of patients requiring palliative care and serve as an endpoint for evaluating the effectiveness of palliative care interventions in ICU settings, including post-discharge outcomes related to post-intensive care syndrome affecting both patients and families.

The underlying hypothesis is that a patient-centered measurement instrument addressing physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs from a palliative care perspective for ICU patients can be developed and validated based on the IPOS. Additionally, demographic data, clinical course, ICU interventions (e.g., mechanical ventilation, dialysis, palliative care consultations, family discussions, and therapy goal limitations), as well as SOFA scores and Palliative Phase of Illness (PPoI) classifications at the time of IPOS-ICU assessment, will be collected. It is hypothesized that IPOS-ICU scores will correlate with disease severity (as measured by SOFA and PPoI) and poor ICU outcomes, including length of stay, mortality, and discharge location. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that interventions such as palliative care consultations will be associated with lower IPOS-ICU scores. In the first phase of the study, an international and multiprofessional expert panel with experience in both intensive and palliative care will adapt the IPOS questionnaire for ICU patients, resulting in the development of the IPOS-ICU. The following modification strategies will be applied: rewording, removal, addition of items, adjustment of recall periods, and inclusion of a ""cannot assess"" response option. Online meetings will be conducted with representatives from Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, and the United States. A larger review team will then evaluate the adapted version, and an informal ""comfort consultation"" will be conducted in ICU settings to ensure that the IPOS-ICU is considered appropriate and acceptable by ICU staff. Following adaptation, the validation phase will be conducted using a multicenter design. After obtaining informed consent from study participants, the IPOS-ICU will be administered at designated time points identified during the adaptation process. ICU staff (including at least one nursing professional and one medical professional) will complete the IPOS-ICU. The questionnaire will include an assessment of the PPoI (categorized as stable, unstable, deteriorating, dying, or deceased), and a free-text field for recording the estimated number of hours spent with the patient.

Despite recent advances, it remains a major health issue due to late-stage diagnosis and high patient and societal burden. New insights into tumor and immune pathways have led to the development of targeted therapies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and therapeutic antibodies. Among these, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and durvalumab have significantly improved outcomes for some patients by reactivating T-cell responses.

The LCAb (Lung Cancer Antibodies) research project focuses on studying the interindividual variability of clinical response to ICI in lung cancer. These therapies are now used across various lung cancer types and stages, including early and advanced disease.

NCT07004699,"Comparison of Two Ventilation Methods During Endoscopy of the Pharynx, Larynx and Oesophagus",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004699,OPTIGO,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Around 15,000 ENT cancers are diagnosed each year in France. The majority of these cancers will at one time or another require an Endoscopy of the Pharynx, Larynx and Esophagus (Endo-PLE or suspension laryngoscopy). Endoscopies of the Otorhinolaryngeal (ENT) sphere are common procedures. They consist of inserting a rigid laryngoscope through the mouth, allowing full exposure of the laryngeal sphere. They are performed in most cases as part of a swelling assessment, following CT scans, or following the discovery of a mass upon palpation of the patient. Unfortunately, these are aggressive cancers that subsequently require major surgery and additional treatment by radio or chemotherapy. This examination can also be performed on patients suffering from swallowing disorders, following the appearance of polyps, and this time not requiring an adjuvant to surgery but their removal. For all patients, these endo-PLE are performed in the operating room and require general anesthesia. This surgical procedure is now performed by performing two laryngoscopies. The first is used to maintain good pulmonary oxygenation by introducing an oxygen cannula, the second constitutes the surgical procedure itself. The oxygen cannula is placed through the nasal cavity, directly up to the entrance of the vocal cords. This procedure is not without risk both for the patient (risk of dental breakage and bleeding during laryngoscopy) but also for the surgeon, because the cannula itself can obstruct his vision. It would be possible to do without one of them by setting up high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT). This device has been widely deployed in continuous care and intensive care units, but is not yet the subject of much research in surgical units. The HFOT consists of oxygen cannulae delivering a mixture of gases at a high flow rate ranging from 20 to 70 liters per minute. The investigator want to evaluate through this study, the feasibility and effectiveness of setting up HFOT during procedures.

NCT07004686,Effect of MGRNOX Index-Guided General Anesthesia on Opioid Consumption in Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004686,,RECRUITING,"1. Pain management is a crucial part of general anesthesia surgery. Nociception monitoring can help anesthesiologists better titrate the use of intraoperative analgesic drugs, especially the opioid.
2. Although a variety of nociception monitoring devices have been developed to date, there is not a specific monitoring indicator that serves as the ""gold standard"" to objectively guide analgesic management in general anesthesia.
3. The MGRNOX index, which is derived from electroencephalogram (EEG), is used to reflect the correlation between noxious stimuli and opioid analgesics in a state of general anesthesia by converting and quantifying the EEG signals collected by the instrument. However, no studies have so far verified the effect of the MGRNOX index-guided analgesic management of general anesthesia on the consumption of opioids in patients.

Aalana Palana draws from the Nurturing Care Framework that provides guidance on giving children the best start in their lives.

Aalana Palana was developed through extensive community engagement, using culturally relevant and locally adaptable video content. This participatory approach ensured its acceptability and contributed to its success in addressing critical gaps in child growth and development. It was delivered entirely within the existing Integrated Child Development Scheme which ensured its sustainability. The innovative use of facilitated video-viewing allowed for standardized delivery of evidence-based practices, around optimal nutrition and parenting during the first 1000 days, reducing the burden on frontline workers while improving caregiver engagement and comprehension.

This intervention was used by Anganwadi workers to conduct group and individual counselling sessions with caregivers in their communities. Aalana Palana implemented a transition from traditional paper-based counselling sessions to a video-based, discussion and demonstration led counselling model. Age specific videos promoted responsive and sensitive parenting, early learning opportunities for children \& include desired nutritional practices for young children \& pregnant women. The content not only describes 'WHAT' behaviours caregiver should adopt, 'HOW' they could include these behaviours in their routines but also 'WHY' a particular behaviour is important for their child's development.

A key strength of this study is its policy relevance. Aalana Palana has been incorporated into the ICDS guidelines for Supplementary Nutrition Program in Telangana, providing a blueprint for scaling similar programs across the country and in other LMICs.",NO,Child Development|Child Nutrition and Early Child Development,BEHAVIORAL: Aalana Palana,"Caregiver Reported Early Development Instruments (CREDI), A caregiver-reported population-level measure of early childhood development for children aged 0-36 months, was used to assess child development through easily observable milestones and behaviours, focusing on developmental progress.

A comprehensive patient assessment, including evaluations of frailty and sarcopenia, could optimize care by identifying those at risk for poor outcomes or poor treatment tolerance. Frailty, characterized by reduced physiological reserves, and sarcopenia, defined as a loss of muscle mass and strength, are both associated with increased mortality and morbidity risks.

NCT07004569,Angiolite Registry Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004569,,RECRUITING,"Left main coronary artery (LMCA) is a major branch of coronary artery and supplies a large bulk of myocardium. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using contemporary drug eluting stent (DES) is one of the treatment options for patients with significant LMCA disease and suitable anatomy as multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of PCI in the treatment of LMCA disease. There are a few challenges in LMCA PCI due to certain anatomical and structural factors. The LMCA disease frequently involves bifurcations which requires special considerations such as side-branch access and preservation in order to prevent procedural related myocardial infarction (MI). Implantation of a metallic scaffold across the LMCA bifurcation often requires aggressive post-dilatation of the LMCA stent due to the diameter discrepancy between the side-branch and the LMCA main body. However, overexpansion beyond the rated diameter might compromise the stent integrity and radial force, resulting in mal-apposition, vascular recoil and risk of subsequent target lesion failure (TLF). The Angiolite stent is a thin-strut cobalt-chromium sirolimus-eluting stent with an open-cell design and a high overexpansion capacity that might overcomes some of these challenges in LMCA PCI. The ANGIOLITE randomized trial confirmed the non-inferiority of the Angiolite stent against the conventional DES. However, patients with LMCA involvement were specifically excluded from the trial.

NCT07004270,Evaluation of the Impact of Emergency Advanced Practice Nurses One Year After Implementation in the Adult Emergency Department of a French University Hospital - A Monocentric Cross-sectional Observational Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004270,IMPACTED,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"In France and around the world, emergency care facilities are facing increasing demand, with rising waiting times. Differentiating care pathways, notably by opening a fast-track unit, helps to improve patient flow and waiting time; which contributes to patient satisfaction. However, a link between patient satisfaction and waiting time is not always found when patients perceive a humanistic approach in care.

The implementation of an advanced practice nurse in an emergency department is a way to graduate the offer of care and reduce waiting times before consultation and length of stay for patients with minor degree of severity. In this care context, Advanced Practice Nurses maintain and even improve patient satisfaction.

Since July 2024, two Advanced Practice Nurses have integrated Poitiers University Hospital's adult emergency department. Considering the existing and ongoing literature to our knowledge, an evaluation of the impact of emergency Advanced Practice Nurses 1 year after their implementation in a French University Hospital would be the first study of its kind.

According to the results of previous international studies, we assume that emergency Advanced Practice Nurses activities have a positive impact on the French healthcare system: on the quality of care perceived by patients and on the emergency care pathways of all fast-track patients by maintaining the same level of safety. We aim to evaluate the impact of emergency Advanced Practice Nurses in a French University Hospital on patient perception of quality of care, safety and patient care pathways in emergency departments.

Our monocentric cross-sectional observational study is a prospective survey of patient satisfaction and experience with a satisfaction questionnaire; and a retrospective survey on routine care data.

Our main objective is to evaluate the impact of emergency Advanced Practice Nurses in a French University Hospital on patient-perceived quality of care by measuring the overall satisfaction of patients who receive care from Advanced Practice Nurses during their emergency care pathway. Overall patient satisfaction will be measured in a survey conducted with a patient satisfaction and experience questionnaire.

Our secondary objectives are several:

* Assess patients' acceptability of being cared by an emergency Advanced Practice Nurse
* Evaluate patient satisfaction with the communication and care relationship with an emergency Advanced Practice Nurse
* Evaluate the rate of recommendation of an emergency Advanced Practice Nurse by the patients who receive care from an Advanced Practice Nurse
* Evaluate the safety of care pathways including an emergency Advanced Practice Nurse
* Evaluate the impact of emergency Advanced Practice Nurses implementation on emergency care pathways for fast-track patients

Consistent with each objective and outcome, we will compare:

* groups before and after the implementation of emergency Advanced Practice Nurses
* or subgroups in the period after implementation of advanced practice nurses: with and without emergency Advanced Practice Nurses intervention The anonymous patient satisfaction and experience survey will be sent by a link in a verified e-mail during the emergency department visit of patients included in the study, admitted to emergency department between 02/06/2025 and 29/06/2025.

Routine care data will be collected from Poitiers hospital medical records for fast-track patients who did not refuse to take part in the study during the following periods:

* Before Advanced Practice Nurses' implementation from 05/27/2024 to 06/23/2024

NCT07004088,The Effect of Mandala Coloring on Symptom Burden and Self-Care in Female Dialysis Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07004088,mandala and HD,COMPLETED,"In kidney patients, especially the continuous dialysis treatment can cause symptoms which adversely affect patients' self-care abilities and quality of life. T Nonpharmacological methods can be used to reduce low and moderate symptoms. Mandala is one of the non-pharmacological approaches and is used in many areas with its therapeutic properties.

In the literature review on the effect of mandala application on dialysis patients symptoms and self care, no research was found. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of mandala coloring on dialysis symptoms and self-care of female patients receiving hemodialysis treatment.

Data were collected by using personal information form, Dialysis Symptom Index Scale, Self-Care Power Scale for Chronic Dialysis Patients.

As an intervention tool, a circular mandala and 12 felt paint were used in the study.

Study was designed as a randomized control study Intervention Group; voluntary consent form, personal information form, ""Dialysis Symptom Index Scale"", ""Self-Care Power Scale for Chronic Dialysis Patients"" were filled. One hour after the start of each dialysis session, the patients were given mandalas for 20-30 minutes and asked to paint. After the sixth dialysis session , the patients were asked to refill the scales with one-on-one interviews, and the verbal opinions and feedback of the patients about the application were taken.

Control Group; Female patients undergoing dialysis treatment in the dialysis unit were informed about the study.

(2005) to determine the symptoms experienced by HD patients and the level of impact on patients. The Turkish reliability and validity of the scale was made by Önsöz and Yeşilbalkan (2013) and Cronbach's alpha value was reported as 0.84. DSI identifies 30 symptoms, either physical or emotional. In DSI, the symptoms experienced in the last week are answered as yes-no, and if the answer is yes, the extent to which the symptoms affected the patients who answered ""yes"" was evaluated as 0 = no, 1 = none, 2 = some, 3 = sometimes, 4 = very little, 5 = too much. The total scale score is obtained by adding the obtained scores. The score of the scale ranges from 0-150. The fact that the answers given to the scale increased towards 150 points indicates that the effect of the symptom in question increased. The internal consistency coefficient of the scale was determined as 0.84 (Usta, 2013)., After voluntary consent is obtained, the scale filled in by interviewing the patients one-on-one before the mandala painting attempt begins. 4 weeks after the completion of the mandala colouring the scale replenished|Self-Care Agency Scale for Patients on Long-Term Dialysis, The scale was developed by Besey Ören in 2010 for HD and peritoneal dialysis patients. The Self-Care Agency Scale is an easily understandable, 22-item, 3-point Likert-type scale. The items are scored as follows: 0=I always apply, 1=I sometimes apply, and 2=I do not apply at all. It was created for people to express their status of applying selfcare habits in their daily lives. The patient is asked to choose the most appropriate option for him. The total score obtainable from the tool ranges between 0 and 44. Subscale scores are obtained by summing the item scores under each subscale. Accordingly, scores obtainable from the subscales are 0-12 for the use of medicine, 0-10 for diet, 0-8 for self-monitoring, 0-4 for hygienic care, and 0-6 for mental state. It shows that as the score obtained from the scale decreases, self-care ability decreases.16 The α coefficient of the scale was 0.67., After voluntary consent is obtained, the scale filled in by interviewing the patients one-on-one before the mandala painting attempt begins. 4 weeks after the completion of the mandala colouring the scale replenished",,,Atlas University,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,82,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE,29.05.2024/03.06.2024,2024-09-10,2025-01-30,2025-01-30,2025-06-04,,2025-06-04,"Dialysis Center, Istanbul, Turkey",

Parents are asked to rate the frequency of responses in their children to 125 common experiences using a Likert scale format. These questions and responses are divided into eight categories: Auditory, Visual, Activity Level, Taste/Smell, Body Position, Movement, Touch, and Emotional/Social. The sensory profile was deemed appropriate for children ages 3-10 and was standardized on 1,200 children with and without disabilities. Content and construct validity have been established. Responses are summarized in six sensory processing domains (Auditory Processing, Visual Processing, Vestibular Processing, Tactile Processing, Multisensory Processing, Oral Sensory Processing), five modulation processes, and three behavioral and emotional responses domains. The validity and reliability studies of the scale in Turkish., Both assessments will take 15 minutes each, one at the beginning of the study, the day before the intervention, and one at the end of the study, the day after the intervention.|Executive Function/Self Regulation, The scale consists of 3 levels of applications. At the first level, the child is asked to touch his feet when he is told to ""touch his head"" and to touch his head when he is told to ""touch his feet"". If he is successful at this level, he is asked to touch his shoulders when he is told to ""touch his knee"" and to touch his knees when he is told to ""touch his shoulder"". If he is successful at this level, he is asked to touch his knees when he is told to ""touch his head"", to touch his shoulders when he is told to ""touch his feet"", to touch his feet when he is told to ""touch his shoulder"" and to touch his head when he is told to ""touch his knees"". If he can do the given command without any mistakes, he is given 2 points, if he is oriented towards the wrong and does it correctly, he is given 1 point and if he gives the wrong answer, he is given 0 points. A total score of 0-60 is given with 10 applications at each level. As the score increases, the self-regulation score will increase., Both assessments will take 30 minutes each, one at the beginning of the study, the day before the intervention, and one at the end of the study, the day after the intervention.|Occupational Performance, The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is a general questionnaire based on a semistructured interview. The semistructured design allows individuals to identify important occupations that they have difficulty performing. COPM is derived from the Canadian Activity Performance Model, which defines occupational performance as the ability to organize, select, and perform meaningful occupations that are culturally defined and age-appropriate for taking care of oneself, enjoying life, building the economic fabric of society, and contributing to the social world. The fifth version of the COPM was published in 2014 and its Turkish adaptation has been made., Both assessments will take 10 minutes each, one at the beginning of the study, the day before the intervention, and one at the end of the study, the day after the intervention.|Problematic Media Use, It was developed to determine problematic media use in children between the ages of 4 and 11. The items of the scale were created by taking into account the Internet Gaming Disorder criteria expressed in DSM V. The scale consists of a 27-item form. The scale is Likert-type and each item is scored between 1 (never) and 5 (always). The total score obtained from the Problematic Media Use Scale is calculated by averaging the scores obtained from all items. High scores obtained from the scale indicate problematic use. While the scale, which is filled out by parents considering the child's behavior, does not provide information on the problematic use of a specific media tool, it tries to determine the problematic use of visual media tools (such as phones, tablets, computers, televisions) in general, in other words, screen addiction., Both assessments will take 5 minutes each, one at the beginning of the study, the day before the intervention, and one at the end of the study, the day after the intervention.|Occupational Profile, This assessment tool comprises 25 items organized into six sections. The initial five sections (volition, habituation, communication \& interaction skills, process skills, motor skills) evaluate the child's personal attributes and their influence on participation and performance in various activities. The final section investigates the impact of the environment on the child's capacity to engage in and perform these activities.

A four-point ordinal scale is employed for scoring individual items, using the following codes:

F = Facilitates A = Allows I = Inhibits R = Restricts participation

Numerical values are assigned to each code, ranging from 4 to 0. Specifically, 'F' is assigned a value of 4, 'A' is 3, 'I' is 2, and 'R' is 1.

The item scores are summed, yielding a maximum total score of 100 for the entire assessment.

NCT07003776,Evaluation of Tumor Budding In Colorectal Adenocarcinoma,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07003776,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most prevalent cancers globally, with approximately one to two million new cases diagnosed each year. This makes CRC the third most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths, with 700,000 deaths per year, exceeded only by lung, liver and stomach cancers. CRC accounts for about 10% of all cancer diagnoses worldwide (Sung et al., 2021; Masetti et al., 2022) .

CRC affects different races and ethnicities at various age groups in distinct ways. Among patients younger than 50 years old, the proportion of CRC is nearly double for Black individuals (16%) compared to White individuals (9%) and Hispanic individuals (6%). In Egypt, CRC ranked the seventh among cancers, following lung, breast, prostate, liver, and bladder cancers (Mounir et al., 2022).

Tumor budding (TB) is characterized by the presence of individual tumor cells or small clusters of up to four cells at the invasive margin of a tumor. This histological feature, which indicates the separation of malignant cells from the main tumor mass, has intrigued pathologists since it was first identified in the 1950s (Giordano et al., 2024).

Evaluating TB is crucial for improving prognostic accuracy and informing treatment decisions. Tumors with high-grade TB exhibit a significantly lower 5-year Disease-Free Survival (DFS) rate compared to those with low-grade TB. High-grade TB is regarded as a negative prognostic factor and is associated with an increased risk of recurrence (Kyong Shin et al., 2023).

TB can be observed in conventional slides when prominent, but careful observation is necessary. A more thorough assessment of TB is more easily achieved if the neoplastic epithelium is highlighted using pan-cytokeratin immunostains (Mishra et al., 2022).

Pan-keratin (Pan-CK) antibodies are proteins derived from cytoskeletal intermediate filaments. These antibodies are a mixture designed to detect multiple low and high molecular weight keratins. Their primary purpose is to allow for the immunohistochemical identification of all epithelial cell types, regardless of their tissue of origin, using a single diagnostic tool.

In surgical pathology, Pan-CK antibodies are commonly used to confirm the epithelial origin of both neoplastic (tumorous) and non-neoplastic tissues, as well as to identify small metastases in lymph nodes. However, there are limitations to the assumption that Pan-CK antibodies will stain all epithelial tumors and that non-epithelial tissues will be ""keratin negative."" It has been reported that a diverse range of epithelial tumors can be Pan-CK negative, challenging the notion that these antibodies are universally applicable (Wick et al., 1986; Badzio, 2019).

Pan-CK can help diagnose disease like breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. It is often used in conjunction with other antibodies for these specific cancers (Chu and Weiss, 2002).",NO,Colorectal Adenocarcinoma,OTHER: Biological: Immunohistochemical staining,"Evaluation of Tumor Budding in Colorectal Adenocarcinoma, Histological assessment and immunohistochemical highlighting of tumor Budding by Pan-CK., 6 months","Correlation of Tumor Budding with clinicopathological parameters, Correlation between different grades of Tumor Budding in Colorectal Carcinoma cells and some clinical and pathological parameters as age, sex, tumor phenotype and nodal status., 6 months",,Sohag University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,50,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,Soh-Med--25-5-2MS,2025-10-01,2026-05-03,2026-05-03,2025-06-04,,2025-06-04,,

Functional imaging studies investigate either the ""state"" dimension (i.e., the measurement of changes in brain area activation at the precise moment of AH onset) or the ""trait"" dimension (i.e., the neural correlates of the propensity to hallucinate). A corollary of AH (particularly acoustic-verbal) is the activation of brain regions involved in the auditory perception of speech (auditory cortex). One theory is that patients with schizophrenia with AH may have a deficit in processing their internal speech (i.e., external attribution to internal verbal content). However, there is little clinical data on the specific role of the mesencephalic region of the inferior colliculi (IC) in the formation of these symptoms. Preliminary research has shown intense expression of dopamine D2 receptors, particularly on glutamatergic neurons in mouse ICs.

NCT07003490,Radical Resection With Contralateral Lymph Node Dissection for Clinical N3 NSCLC,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07003490,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"\*Study Overview This study is investigating a surgical approach for patients with a serious type of lung cancer known as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly those in an advanced stage where cancer has spread to both sides of the chest (referred to as N3 stage). In these patients, the cancer has spread to contralateral lymph nodes, which are lymph nodes located on the opposite side of the chest. This spread makes the cancer harder to treat and lowers the chance of survival.

The study is focusing on whether removing the primary lung tumor along with lymph nodes from both sides of the chest-a surgery called bilateral lymph node dissection-can improve the chances of survival and reduce the risk of cancer returning.

\*Why This Study Is Important Stage N3 NSCLC (where cancer has spread to both sides of the chest) is hard to treat and has a poor prognosis. Current treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, but the long-term survival rates are still low.

This study will evaluate whether surgery alone (with the tumor and lymph nodes removed) can improve survival in these patients compared to other treatment options.

The goal is to find the best way to treat patients with N3 stage NSCLC by studying the risks and benefits of this combined surgical approach.

* What the Study Is Testing

  1. Effectiveness of surgery for N3 stage patients: Does removing both the primary tumor and lymph nodes from both sides of the chest improve survival rates?
  2. Safety of the surgery: What are the risks or complications from such an extensive operation? For example, the study will check for things like infections, lung function problems, and other side effects.
  3. Impact of other treatments: The study will also look at whether treatments like chemotherapy or radiation before surgery (called neoadjuvant therapy) change the results of surgery.
  4. Impact of lymph node involvement: The study will examine how many lymph nodes are affected by cancer and how this affects treatment outcomes.
* Who Can Participate? The study is looking for people diagnosed with N3 stage NSCLC, meaning their cancer has spread to lymph nodes on both sides of the chest. Patients must be considered eligible for surgery based on their overall health and the specific characteristics of their cancer.
* What Will the Patients Experience? Patients who take part in this study will undergo surgery to remove their lung tumor and lymph nodes from both sides of the chest.

They will receive follow-up care to monitor for any complications, such as infections, and to see if the cancer comes back.

Patients will be monitored for several years to track their survival, recurrence of cancer, and any long-term effects of the surgery.

\*What Could This Mean for Patients? If the study shows that this combined surgery approach is effective, it could become a standard treatment for patients with N3 stage NSCLC, improving their chances of survival and possibly reducing the need for more aggressive treatments like chemotherapy or radiation in the future.

However, it's important to note that surgery of this type comes with risks, and not all patients will be suitable candidates for this approach. The study aims to better understand these risks and benefits to help doctors make the best treatment decisions for each individual patient.

\*Key Takeaways for Healthcare Providers The study is investigating radical surgery for N3 stage NSCLC, with an emphasis on bilateral lymph node dissection to improve survival.

The study will assess surgical outcomes, complications, and long-term survival rates in patients with metastasis to lymph nodes on both sides of the chest.

NCT07003334,Correlation of Psychological Distress and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Gastric Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07003334,PDICI,RECRUITING,"1. Background Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading global cause of cancer-related mortality, with over 1 million new cases and 769,000 deaths in 2020. In China, 80% of patients present with advanced disease, for whom perioperative chemotherapy, surgery, and lymphadenectomy are standard. Recent phase III trials (Checkmate-649, KEYNOTE-062, ORIENT-16) demonstrate that immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) combined with chemotherapy improve progression-free survival (PFS: 2.8-10.5 months) and overall survival (OS: 11.1-18.4 months) compared to chemotherapy alone. However, outcomes remain suboptimal, necessitating exploration of novel predictive biomarkers and resistance mechanisms.

   Emerging evidence implicates chronic stress in cancer progression and treatment response. Chronic stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system, elevating cortisol, catecholamines, and glucocorticoids. These hormones suppress immune function by reducing CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cell activity while increasing immunosuppressive cells (e.g., regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells). Preclinical studies link chronic stress to metastasis via extracellular trap (NET) formation, impaired antitumor immunity, and resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Clinically, chronic stress correlates with worse survival in non-small-cell lung cancer patients receiving ICIs. Despite these findings, psychological screening remains underutilized in oncology. This study aims to investigate the impact of chronic stress on ICI efficacy in advanced gastric cancer.

NCT07003243,Effectiveness of Topical Application of Melatonin On Bone Density and Implant Stability In Immediate Implantation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07003243,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Dental implants have revolutionized the replacement of missing teeth, offering predictable and long-lasting rehabilitation for both fully and partially edentulous patients. Since Brånemark's landmark work in 1969, which defined osseointegration as ""a direct structural and functional connection between ordered living bone and the surface of a load-bearing implant"" (Brånemark et al., 1969), implantology has become an integral part of restorative dentistry.

Traditionally, implant therapy followed a delayed protocol requiring a healing period of up to six months after extraction to allow complete soft and hard tissue regeneration before implant placement (Adell et al., 1981). This approach was based on the belief that mature bone is essential for achieving osseointegration. However, subsequent research demonstrated that immediate placement of implants into fresh extraction sockets can also lead to successful osseointegration without compromising outcomes (Araujo et al., 2005).

Immediate implant placement, defined as placing an implant at the time of tooth extraction, has gained popularity due to its clinical benefits. These include a reduction in surgical sessions, shortened overall treatment time, preservation of the alveolar ridge, especially the buccal plate, and superior soft tissue esthetics (Van Der Weijden et al., 2009). However, these advantages are contingent upon achieving primary implant stability and proper case selection. A biological challenge that often arises in such cases is the presence of a ""jumping gap"" - a void between the implant surface and the socket wall - which may require the use of bone grafts or regenerative materials to facilitate bone fill and stability.

In recent years, research has explored various biologically active molecules and growth factors to enhance bone healing and implant integration, especially in immediate placement protocols. These include bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and platelet-derived growth factors. Among these, melatonin has emerged as a promising agent due to its multifaceted biological activity (Zechner et al., 2003).

Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is an endogenously produced neurohormone primarily secreted by the pineal gland. While best known for regulating circadian rhythms, melatonin also possesses strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and bone-promoting properties. It enhances osteoblast proliferation, stimulates collagen matrix formation, and inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. These effects make melatonin a potential therapeutic agent for improving bone density and implant stability.

Topical application of melatonin at implant sites has shown encouraging results in experimental models, demonstrating improved bone-to-implant contact, accelerated bone regeneration, and enhanced mechanical stability. These findings suggest a potential role for melatonin in immediate implant protocols, where rapid healing and early osseointegration are critical for clinical success.

Given the biological potential of melatonin, the present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of topical application of melatonin on bone density and implant stability in immediate implantation cases through a randomized controlled clinical trial.",NO,Immediate Implant Placement|Melatonin Production,DRUG: Local melatonin powder,"Change in crestal bone level around dental implants, Radiographic measurement of vertical crestal bone loss using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) at baseline and after 6 months to assess the effect of topical melatonin application on bone preservation., Baseline (Day 0) and 6 months postoperatively",,,University of Baghdad,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1,25,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,Melatonin in immediate implant,2025-05-26,2026-05,2026-05,2025-06-04,,2025-06-04,"College of Dentistry, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, 10001, Iraq",

As technology continues to evolve, tech-assisted learning has emerged as a notable approach in modern education. Among these technologies, VR has gained significant attention for its ability to provide immersive and interactive learning environments for both educators and students. VR applications have expanded into the medical field and are increasingly integrated into health science education. Recently, VR tools have moved beyond desktop-based systems to more accessible platforms like mobile apps and head-mounted displays. In medical education, 3D environments enable engaging and self-directed learning that helps learners understand anatomical structures and build confidence in practical skills. In physical therapy, practical education is important, as therapists must accurately choose and perform special tests. Studies suggest that VR-based training is effective in practical education in physical therapy. Although VR has been applied in rehabilitation for stroke and osteoarthritis patients, VR-based educational research targeting undergraduate physical therapy students is lacking.

NCT07003048,Life vs. Digital Music Interventions Performed by Professionals Throughout Pregnancy to Increase Mental Health for Mothers and Their Offspring,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07003048,MusicMums,RECRUITING,"This prospective study was preceded by an extensive feasibility study between 2021-2024. Thereby, pregnant women were exposed to live music and a variety of creative workshops such as vibration, modelling, creative writing, singing, dancing and active listening to concerts from 12 gestational weeks onwards up to delivery at two-week intervals. The investigators detected significant changes in affection detected by the PANAS-test, cortisol from buccal swabs, and maternal heart rate variability before and after the interventions. Similarly, the investigators could detect significant changes by validated questionnaires for maternal stress (PSS), maternal anxiety detected by STAI and the risk of depression detected by EPDS.

Therefore, from January 2025 onwards, the investigators integrated ""only"" concerts and workshops in singing and dancing as relevant interventions. In a comparative prospective study, the investigators now want to study, whether the effects of life participation within the Philharmonic building at approximately 2-week intervals would have the same short-term and medium-term effects as in pregnant women following the same digitalized interventions from home (DIGITALIZED versus LIVE INTERVENTION = DL). This would offer the chance to reach pregnant women in regions with high needs for interventions to reduce stress during pregnancy, such as in areas involved in wars, environmental disasters or other stressful life conditions.

The primary outcomes are short-term differences in affection measured immediately before and after all interventions, and differences in cortisol from buccal swabs, measured twice after concerts during pregnancy.

The secondary outcomes are the medium-term changes throughout pregnancy in validated questionnaires of PSS, STAI and EPDS, the perinatal and neonatal outcomes such as development and tempoerament of the infants by validated questionnaires AGES and STAGES 6 and 12 months after birth and a follow-up of infants after two years by the Parca-R. questionnaire. In addition the gold MSI will be evaluated in both groups to test the affinity to music as well as the correlation with linguistic development by EEG of the newborns.

Hypothesis: Both interventions lead to a rapid reduction in the psychological and physiological stress of pregnant women. The effects may be more pronounced with live music.

A total of 128 women will be assigned to one of two groups. Taking into account a drop-out rate of 5-10% during the course of the study, the investigators expect to have complete data from 116 women (approximately 58 per group) to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.

Based on our previous studies on the reduction of psychological stress and cortisol levels by concert interventions showing significant changes in mean cortisol levels, the effect sizes of the intervention on site are estimated to be moderate: Assuming a moderate effect size (f = 0.25) and a β/α ratio = 4, N = 58 women per group and using 5 repeated measures are needed to detect differences between the two groups.

NCT07003009,Immun Checkpoint Washout in Patients With Invasive Ductal Breast Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07003009,,RECRUITING,"Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of invasive breast cancer. In cases where axillary lymph node metastases are diagnosed through screening, they can be found in up to 25% of cases, and in symptomatic cases, up to 60% of cases. The clinical detection accuracy of axillary lymph node metastases is only 33%. Accurate staging of lymph nodes in breast cancer patients is crucial for both prognosis and treatment. Ultrasonography is much more sensitive than physical examination alone for determining axillary lymph node involvement in breast cancer staging. Fine needle aspiration biopsy or core biopsy is diagnostic in lymph nodes that cannot be clarified solely by ultrasonography or are suspicious. Although biopsy sampling yields high diagnostic rates, it requires an experienced pathologist and sometimes takes weeks to yield results. Therefore, there is a need for faster and less costly diagnostic methods for diagnosing axillary metastases. Among thyroid cancers, papillary thyroid carcinomas, a malignancy in which the lymph node washout method is used to determine lymph node metastasis, are the most common. In papillary thyroid cancer patients, washout sampling of neck lymph nodes by fine needle aspiration, searching for thyroglobulin, a protein normally found in thyroid tissue, is considered one of the most valid methods for detecting lymph node metastasis in this cancer. In recent years, immune checkpoint molecules associated with cancer have been widely used as biomarkers and agents in both diagnosis and treatment for cancer patients. There are numerous publications in the literature regarding the expression of immune checkpoint molecules such as Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) on the cell surface of breast cancer patients. Although the natural soluble forms of receptors and ligands of immune checkpoint molecules exist and they are important components of immune regulation, their exact mechanisms of action have not yet been determined. There are five studies in the literature evaluating the status of soluble immune checkpoint molecules in breast cancer patients, with one being a review article. It is highly likely that immune checkpoint molecules found on both the cell surface and soluble in blood and body fluids are also present in tumor metastatic regions. There is no study using these immunological biomarkers to determine metastasis in invasive ductal carcinoma patients with metastatic axillary lymph nodes ın the literature. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the soluble levels of immune checkpoint molecules in washout fluids obtained from metastatic axillary lymph nodes and benign lymph nodes in patients with invasive ductal breast carcinoma, and will assess the effectiveness of these immune checkpoint molecules and the washout method in diagnosing metastasis.",NO,Breast Cancer Metastatic|Breast Carcinoma,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Malign Lymph Node Washout|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Benign Lymph Node Washout,"The immune checkpoints in lymph node washout fluid, The immune checkpoints (sCD25 (IL-2Ra), 4-1BB, B7.2 (CD86), Free Active Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3), Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), and Galectin-9) will be measured at lymph node washout fluid and the results will be presented in pg/ml., 3 monthts","The immune checkpoints in blood, The immune checkpoints (sCD25 (IL-2Ra), 4-1BB, B7.2 (CD86), Free Active Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3), Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), and Galectin-9) will be measured at serum samples and the results will be presented in pg/ml., 3 monthts",,Istanbul Training and Research Hospital,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,30,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,Breast lymph node,2024-01-01,2025-09-01,2025-10-01,2025-06-04,,2025-06-04,"Istanbul Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, 34098, Turkey",

Patients with MCI have subjective memory complaints corroborated by standard neuropsychological tests but remain functionally autonomous. One of the first brain regions to show AD pathology is the hippocampus (HPC). Reduction in HPC volume is a strong predictor of AD dementia. Therefore, improvement or restoration of HPC structure and function is thus an attractive target for improvement in memory and AD prevention strategies. In the current study, the investigators propose to examine the effects of a 3-month long spatial memory program on spatial memory and the hippocampus in patients diagnosed with MCI. Neuropsychological tests are also administered before and after the training to assess the effects of the intervention on cognition.

Physical therapy's role plays a significant role in treating hip dysplasia by creating new walking habits as an adaptation way and compensation for the deformity \[3\]. Focusing on the muscles that produce hip abduction force is a basic item of the hip dysplasia rehabilitation program \[4\]. Cross-legged sitting position can be considered as a common and easy position that might enhance the range of motion of the lower limb joints \[5\].

While unilateral hip developmental dysplasia has been widely distributed among newborns, especially in the last few years, the role of engaging the cross-legged sitting technique as a part of physical therapy and rehabilitation programs on improving the temporospatial parameters, muscular electrical activity and foot pressure distributing is still not clear. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the effects of engaging the cross-legged sitting technique as a part of physical therapy and rehabilitation program among patients with UHDD by comparing the group who participated in rehabilitation program with CLS to the other without.

To understand the importance of including Cross-legged sitting technique in physical therapy and rehabilitation program of Unilateral Hip Developmental Dysplasia (UHDD) to enhance the spatial and temporal measures, achieving a healthy distribution of foot pressure, increasing the electrical activity of lower limb muscles and improving the overall gait pattern.

NCT07002788,Comparison Paravertebral and Serratus Anterior Plane Block in Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07002788,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a minimally invasive alternative to thoracotomy that emerged in the early 1990s, aiming to reduce surgical stress and postoperative pain. While VATS generally results in less pain than thoracotomy, patients may still experience significant discomfort. Effective pain control remains crucial in VATS to minimize postoperative complications, especially pulmonary and cardiac events, which can arise from inadequate ventilation and impaired sputum clearance due to pain.

Various strategies have been developed to manage postoperative pain, with multimodal approaches-combining regional or peripheral blocks with systemic analgesics such as NSAIDs and adjuvants-now considered standard. Among regional techniques, serratus anterior plane (SAP) block and thoracic paravertebral block (PVB) are commonly used. SAP block targets the thoracodorsal, long thoracic, and T2-T9 spinal nerves between the latissimus dorsi and serratus anterior muscles, providing effective anterolateral chest wall analgesia. PVB targets intercostal nerves within the paravertebral space and has shown superior pain control and improved lung function compared to systemic opioids or intrapleural local anesthetics.

At our center, both SAP and PVB are routinely used for postoperative analgesia in VATS procedures for patients with lung masses. Pain levels will be assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), a reliable tool for evaluating both acute and chronic pain, unaffected by age or gender.

This study aims to compare the effectiveness of SAP and PVB blocks in terms of postoperative pain, opioid requirements, and block-related complications in patients undergoing VATS under general anesthesia.

NCT07002671,The Role of Preoperative HALP Score in Differentiating Complicated Acute Appendicitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07002671,Appendicitis,COMPLETED,"Acute abdomen is a frequently encountered clinical condition that can be fatal if not diagnosed early. Acute appendicitis is one of the causes of acute abdomen and is the most common clinical condition leading to acute abdomen worldwide. Therefore, early diagnosis is crucial. Delays in diagnosis can lead to the complication of appendicitis and an increase in its complications, further worsening the clinical picture and raising morbidity and mortality rates.

In patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis, distinguishing between complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis is vital for treatment planning. The evaluation of patients' laboratory and radiological findings are widely used methods in clinical practice for this differentiation.

Recent studies have shown the HALP score has become a new prognostic biomarker in the literature, used to predict a range of clinical outcomes in various neoplasms. To date, the HALP score has been used to evaluate outcomes and prognosis in gastric, colorectal, bladder, prostate, and other cancers, as well as in many other diseases.

NCT07002541,PECS-II vs ESP in Nociception Level Index Guided Breast Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07002541,NOL,RECRUITING,"Background:

Breast surgery is often associated with significant perioperative pain. While systemic opioids are commonly used, their side effects (nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, delayed recovery) have encouraged the adoption of regional anesthesia techniques for better analgesia and reduced opioid requirements. PECS-II and Erector Spinae Plane (ESP) blocks are two effective regional techniques frequently utilized in breast surgery. However, comparative data on their impact on intraoperative opioid consumption under nociception-guided anesthesia remains limited.

The Nociception Level Index (NOL) is an objective monitoring tool that integrates multiple physiological signals (e.g., heart rate variability, skin conductance, pulse amplitude) to assess nociceptive responses in real-time. When used intraoperatively, it enables more precise opioid titration, potentially optimizing analgesia while minimizing opioid exposure.

Objective:

To compare the efficacy of PECS-II and ESP blocks in reducing intraoperative remifentanil consumption during breast surgery under general anesthesia guided by NOL monitoring.

Methods:

This prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted at Koç University Hospital following ethical approval. Ninety female patients aged 18-80 years, classified as ASA I-III and scheduled for elective mastectomy or other breast surgeries, were randomly assigned into three groups (n=30 each):

Group 1 (PECS-II Block) Group 2 (ESP Block) Group 3 (Control - no block) Regional blocks were performed before surgery with ultrasound guidance. PECS-II block was administered at the 3rd to 5th rib levels in the mid-axillary line using 30 mL of 0.3% bupivacaine. ESP block was applied at T2-T5 levels with a total of 20 mL 0.5% bupivacaine.

All patients received standardized general anesthesia, including propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium, and desflurane maintenance. Remifentanil infusion (0.05-0.1 μg/kg/min) was titrated based on NOL values every 5 minutes: increased by 0.03 μg/kg/min if NOL \>25, and decreased by 0.03 μg/kg/min if NOL \<10.

Data collected included:

Total intraoperative remifentanil consumption (primary outcome) NOL scores every 5 minutes Postoperative pain scores (NRS) at 1st, 6th, 12th, and 24th hours (at rest and with arm abduction) Total opioid consumption (morphine, tramadol) in the first 24 hours Opioid-related side effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritus) Length of hospital stay Blinding was applied to data collectors (pain nurses and anesthesia technicians), but due to the nature of the procedures, surgeons and anesthesiologists were not blinded.

Statistical Analysis:

Data were analyzed using SPSS v26. Continuous variables were tested for normality (Shapiro-Wilk), and analyzed with t-tests or Mann-Whitney U as appropriate. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square tests. Significance was set at p\<0.05.

Expected Outcomes and Contribution:

It is hypothesized that both PECS-II and ESP blocks will significantly reduce intraoperative remifentanil consumption compared to the control group. Furthermore, these blocks may improve postoperative pain control, reduce opioid-related side effects, and shorten recovery time.

This study aims to clarify the relative efficacy of two widely used regional blocks in the context of objective, nociception-guided anesthesia.

Previous studies have found that adolescents generally exhibit a moderate level of health-promoting behaviors (Özdemir \& Bülbül, 2023). When behaviors such as regular sleep, stress management, exercise, and adequate and balanced nutrition are adopted by adolescents with the aim of improving health, the need for technology tends to decrease (Bebiş et al., 2015; Özcan et al., 2023; Hysing et al., 2021).

When the existing literature is reviewed, it appears that there is a lack of randomized controlled trials that explain behavior change as a process through health education aimed at promoting healthy behaviors among individuals affected by digital game addiction, which is considered a significant problem in adolescents (Shinde et al., 2020; Yang, 2020). In this context, the aim of this study is to determine the effect of health education provided to adolescents on digital game addiction and health-promoting behaviors.

The population of the study consisted of 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students (n = 825) enrolled at Etimesgut 15 July Martyrs Secondary School located in the city center of Ankara. When the study was completed with 136 participants, a post hoc power analysis indicated that with an effect size of f = 0.25, the study achieved 80% power and 95% confidence (1-α) based on a four-group experimental design with repeated measures ANOVA, with a minimum of 34 participants per group (Cohen, 1992). Considering potential participant loss, the sample size was increased by 15%, and the study was initiated with 160 participants, allocating 40 to each group.

The study will begin after obtaining permission from the Ankara Provincial Directorate of National Education and approval from the Ethics Committee. Following the identification of voluntary adolescents who meet the inclusion criteria, information about the study will be provided to both the adolescents and their parents, and written informed consent will be obtained. In this randomized controlled study based on the Solomon four-group design, participants will be assigned to groups using the block randomization method (Group 1: Intervention Group 1, Group 2: Intervention Group 2, Group 3: Control Group 1, Group 4: Control Group 2). Research data will be collected through a pretest administered to Group 1 (intervention 1) and Group 3 (control 1) immediately after randomization and prior to training, and a post-test administered to all groups at the end of the third month following the completion of the four training sessions.

The intervention groups will receive a standardized health education program delivered over four sessions spanning three months. The timing of the training sessions will be coordinated with the school administration to fit within the school schedule. The data collection tools used in the study include the Descriptive Information Form (20 items), the Digital Game Addiction Scale for Children (24 items), and the Adolescent Health Promotion Scale (40 items).

If the data do not follow a normal distribution, non-parametric methods will be used, and analyses will be conducted using the Walrus package in the JAMOVI software. For analyzing the relationships between scales, Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients will be used depending on the normality of the data. For categorical data, if the expected frequency is greater than 25, Pearson's chi-square test will be applied; if it is between 5 and 25, Yates' correction will be used; and if it is less than 5, Fisher's exact test will be employed. For the analysis of numerical demographic data, one-way ANOVA will be used if the data are normally distributed, and the Kruskal-Wallis test will be used if not.

NCT07002437,Hypoxia Pathways for Early Recovery After Spinal Cord Injury,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07002437,HyPER-FLO,RECRUITING,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts neural pathways to respiratory motor neurons, diminishing breathing capacity and airway defense (e.g., cough). Indeed, respiratory impairment is a leading cause of infection, re-hospitalization and death after SCI. There is a critical need for new strategies to restore breathing ability and airway defense in people with SCI. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) - repetitive exposure to brief episodes of low inspired oxygen - is a promising strategy to restore breathing capacity by promoting spinal neuroplasticity. Exciting outcomes in \>12 SCI trials completed to date demonstrate that AIH improves human respiratory and limb function. Unfortunately, \~40% of individuals exhibit minimal response to AIH, making it essential to 1) optimize AIH protocols to maximize functional benefits; and 2) identify genetic biomarkers distinguishing those most/least likely to benefit from AIH-based treatments.

The purpose of the pilot study, to be conducted in a small sample of participants with sub-acute SCI (1 to 6 months post injury), is to preliminarily compare the immediate effects of two intermittent hypoxia protocols. Since AIH-induced plasticity may be induced via serotonin or adenosine-driven mechanisms and these pathways compete and inhibit each other, each protocol favors a distinct mechanistic pathway. The long-term objective is to test the hypothesis that a longer duration (i.e., augmented) hypoxia protocol, favoring adenosine mechanisms, enhances respiratory motor plasticity more than an AIH protocol targeting serotonin mechanisms (low O2 + CO2) in people with sub-acute SCI. Since an individual's genetics can influence the response to rehabilitation, investigators are also preliminarily investigating how certain genes are related to breathing changes after these treatments.

NCT07002424,Feasibility and Outcomes of Therapist-led Online Cancer Bereavement Groups,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07002424,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Background: The loss of loved one to cancer brings unique difficulties that impact on the bereavement experience. Mixed support exists for the effectiveness of in-person group interventions for bereaved caregivers, with barriers to accessing support including perceived stigmatisation and geographical constraints. Online bereavement interventions offer an accessible and effective means of providing grief support to various populations at the individual and group level. Research supports the effectiveness of online groups for those bereaved by cancer, although most of these studies are peer-led as opposed to therapist-led. Despite a growing rationale for the use of online groups for bereavement, there is little empirical evidence for therapist led groups, or for those bereaved by cancer. Objectives: This paper describes the protocol for a pilot feasibility trial evaluating the feasibility, potential effectiveness and acceptability of delivering online therapy groups for those bereaved by cancer. Methods and analysis: It will use a longitudinal pilot and feasibility methodology to evaluate a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design and its suitability for a future definitive RCT. Participants: A total of 100 adults who have lost a loved one to cancer will be randomised to receive the intervention immediately or after a delay three months later. Interventions: An eight-session online therapeutic group intervention led over 12 weeks based on models of cognitive behavioural therapy, compassion focused therapy and coping with bereavement. Primary outcome measures: Cancer- bereaved adults' grief intensity, depression, anxiety, PTSD, self-compassion and social disconnection. Acceptability of the intervention will also be measured including what participants found most helpful or unhelpful about the groups and any adverse outcomes. Data collection will occur at baseline, intervention completion and at follow up, 3 months after intervention completion. Results: The feasibility of trial procedures and the effect of the intervention on the outcomes will be tested,. Conclusions: At intervention completion, it is hoped that participants will show reductions across all outcomes measures with improvements remaining at follow up, compared to the waitlist-control group, warranting the need for a full-scale RCT to establish efficacy.

The measure has strong psychometric properties. For example, Ashouri et al., (2024) found that this measure demonstrated good internal consistency (omega coefficient of 0.93), and test-retest reliability with an interval of 6 weeks being 0.89. The PG-13 was shown to be a reliable scale for the assessment of individuals at risk for developing PGD with high scores on internal consistency in bereaved Swedish parents (Pohlkamp et al., 2018). However, these properties have been validated with a few studies., Baseline (1 week pre-group) Session 1(Week 1) Session 2(week 2) Session 3(week 3) Session 4(week 4) Session 5(week 6) Session 6(week 8) Session 7(week 10) Session 8(week 12) Follow up (3 months post-group) WL: Additional follow up (3months post Baseline)|PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, is a 20-item self-report questionnaire that assesses symptoms of PTSD. Blevins et al., (2015) reported that the measure has strong psychometric properties: when tested with trauma-exposed undergraduate students, the internal consistency was 0.94 and the test-retest reliability was 0.82 over a period of a week. There appears to be no validation of the PCL-5 targeting traumatically bereaved individuals., Baseline (1 week pre-group) Session 4(week 4) Session 8(week 12) Follow up (3 months post-group) WL: Additional follow up (3months post Baseline)|The Helpful Aspects of Therapy (HAT; Llewelyn, 1988), is a post-session self - report questionnaire that asks about perceptions of key change processes in therapy. It is partly qualitative and captures perceptions of helpful and unhelpful aspects of the previous session. It is beyond the scope of this present study to analyse the qualitative data, however this measure provides valuable feedback, which the facilitators can be aware of and address if appropriate.

Researchers will aim to foster trusting relationships to help the participants to feel engaged in the research process. Participants will be given opportunities to share their thoughts and reflections during the group to facilitate engagement with the content., Session 1 (Week 1) Session 2 (week 2) Session 3 (week 3) Session 4 (week 4) Session 5 (week 6) Session 6 (week 8) Session 7 (week 10) Session 8 (week 12)|The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS; Neff, 2003), is a 26-item self-report questionnaire that measures self-compassion. Raes et al. (2011) reported that the measure has strong psychometric properties: the internal consistency was 0.85 and the test-retest reliability over a period of five months was 0.71. The total score of the SCS-SF correlates highly (r=0.98) with the longer 26-item Self-Compassion Scale. Construct validity of the SCS-SF has not been tested but the long version of the SCS was negatively correlated (r=-0.65) with the self-criticism subscale of the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire. The SCS-SF has not been validated with bereaved populations., Baseline (1 week pre-group) Session 1(Week 1) Session 2(week 2) Session 3(week 3) Session 4(week 4) Session 5(week 6) Session 6(week 8) Session 7(week 10) Session 8(week 12) Follow up (3 months post-group) WL: Additional follow up (3months post Baseline)|Oxford Grief-Social Disconnection Scale (OG-SD; Smith et al., 2020), is a 15-item scale developed from interviews with bereaved individuals. Smith et al., (2020) indicate that internal consistency for the total OG-SD and its subscales were good or excellent (Cronbach alpha 0.80). The OG-SD showed a good 7-day-retest reliability across the total and subscales, indicating a temporally stable assessment of perceived social disconnection (test-retest 0.94). However, although overall the OG-SD was deemed stable over time, other two subscales may be less stable over time. The test-retest sample was also relatively small, which means that it is possible that large effects may have been caused within a few individuals., Baseline (1 week pre-group) Session 1(Week 1) Session 2(week 2) Session 3(week 3) Session 4(week 4) Session 5(week 6) Session 6(week 8) Session 7(week 10) Session 8(week 12) Follow up (3 months post-group) WL: Additional follow up (3months post Baseline)","Demographic Information- Name, As part of group therapeutic interventions, The Loss Foundation routinely collects outcome measures and demographic information to evaluate the effectiveness of its services.

It consists of a 10-item questionnaire with five response options for respondents, ranging from ""Strongly Agree"" to ""Strongly Disagree."" The score for the System Usability Scale (SUS) is calculated by following these steps:

* For odd-numbered questions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), subtract 1 from the user's rating.
* For even-numbered questions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), subtract the user's rating from 5.
* Add the new values for all 10 questions.
* Multiply this sum by 2.5. This final number gives you a score out of 100.

The System Usability Scale (SUS) score, ranging from 0 to 100, is interpreted to indicate the perceived usability of a system. Higher scores suggest better usability.

Interpreting SUS Scores:

90-100: exceptionally good usability. 80-89: very good usability 70-79: good usability 60-69: the usability is marginal 50-59: Poor usability 0-49: Extremely poor usability, immediately after the intervention",,Istituto Nazionale di Ricovero e Cura per Anziani,,ALL,OLDER_ADULT,NA,200,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER,INRCA_008_2024,2024-12-18,2025-07-30,2025-07-30,2025-06-03,,2025-06-03,"IRCCS INRCA Hospital, Ancona, 60127, Italy",

Participants will be asked to sit on the chair and come forward in the chair until their feet are flat on the floor. Participants will be asked to do a ""stand and sit"" movement once with their arms crossed across their chest. The test will be terminated for those who cannot complete the task or need assistance. Those who successfully complete the first task will be asked to perform five consecutive stand and sit as fast as possible. The timing is started with the command start and stopped at the end of the fifth posture. Our participants test scores will be recorded in seconds using a stopwatch., baseline|4 Meter Walking Speed Test (4MWT), 4MWT is a measure of walking speed, a vital sign of mobility and functionality. In older adults, walking speed is a clinical indicator of conditions such as frailty and sarcopenia. Participants were instructed to start walking at their normal speed 2 m behind the ""start point"" and continue until they passed the ""end point"". Using a stopwatch, the time taken for each participant to walk the 4 m distance between the ""start"" and ""end"" point will be measured. This will be used to calculate walking speed (distance/time)., baseline|Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), This functional test measures the time it takes for an individual to stand up from a standard chair, walk 3 m at normal speed, turn around, walk back to the starting point and sit down. Using a stopwatch, participants test scores are recorded in seconds., baseline|Respiratory muscle strength, Intraoral pressure will be measured with a measuring device.

These vaccines are custom-made for each patient using specific mutations (neoantigens) found in their own tumor. The goal is to help the patient's immune system recognize and attack their cancer.

The study will enroll adult patients (20 years or older) who have solid tumors that meet specific stage-related criteria. These include advanced cancers that are resistant to prior treatments and early-stage cancers at high risk of recurrence, where there are no standard adjuvant therapies available.

Participants will receive:

* A personalized neoantigen peptide vaccine designed from the mutations in their tumor tissue.
* Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol), a substance that stimulates the immune system.
* An anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, a drug that helps the immune system stay active against cancer.

The vaccine and drugs will be given through multiple injections over several months. Blood samples and imaging will be used to monitor the immune response and how the cancer responds to treatment. Participants will be followed for up to 12 months.

This study does not include a placebo group. Every participant will receive the personalized vaccine along with the other therapies.

The primary objectives of this study are:

NCT07002164,Timing of Coronary Angiography in NSTEMI Complicated by Acute HF,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07002164,TIMING-AHF,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Study objectives:

To determine the optimal timing of coronary angiography (CAG) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) complicated by acute decompensated heart failure (AHF). The primary objective of this trial is to test the hypothesis that immediate CAG ≤2 hours after establishment of NSTEMI diagnosis would result in a significant reduction in primary composite outcome of death from any cause, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or hospitalization for heart failure (HF) at 12 months after randomization as compared with delayed CAG after stabilization.

Study hypothesis:

Immediate CAG ≤2 hours after establishment of NSTEMI diagnosis would result in a significant reduction in primary composite outcome of death from any cause, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or hospitalization for heart failure (HF) at 12 months after randomization as compared with delayed CAG after stabilization.

Background:

Although current guidelines recommend early CAG within 2 hours for patients with NSTEMI complicated by AHF, many patients with NSTEMI complicated by AHF did not receive early CAG. However, no randomized clinical trials have evaluated the optimal timing of CAG in patients with NSTEMI complicated by AHF. Therefore, the investigators aimed to perform a prospective, investigator-initiated, open-label, muilticenter trial to compare the efficacy and safety between immediate CAG (CAG \<2 hours after establishment of NSTEMI diagnosis) and delayed CAG after stabilization (i.e. improved dyspnea and disappearance of pulmonary congestion) in participants with NSTEMI complicated by AHF.

NCT07001917,To Explore the Value of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Noninvasive Quantitative Evaluation of Graft Function After Simultaneous Pancreas-kidney Transplantation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07001917,,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"Pancreatic kidney joint transplantation (SPK) has become the standard treatment for patients with diabetes complicated by end-stage renal disease. By simultaneously transplanting the pancreas and kidney, SPK can restore the patient\&#39;s insulin secretion and kidney function after surgery, thereby significantly improving the patient\&#39;s quality of life and extending life expectancy. However, the high incidence of postoperative complications, especially organ dysfunction, remains a major challenge. Complications of organ dysfunction include thrombosis of the pancreatic graft, acute rejection, graft pancreatitis, and acute tubular necrosis of the renal graft. Early diagnosis and monitoring of these complications are crucial for improving patient prognosis and extending the life of the transplanted organs.

Although some methods are currently used in clinical practice to assess graft function, such as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and Gates method of renal dynamic imaging, these methods still have significant limitations. For example, traditional biochemical markers for predicting kidney function are affected by many irrelevant factors and lack accuracy. While the Gates method is widely used, its long examination process, high cost, and radiation exposure limit its feasibility in routine postoperative application. In addition, although tissue biopsy is considered the gold standard for assessing renal pathology, its invasiveness and potential complications limit its application. In view of the shortcomings of traditional methods, there is an urgent need for a non-invasive, dynamic, and accurate detection method for the early diagnosis of post-SPK organ dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown great potential in the assessment of transplanted organ function due to its non-invasiveness, high soft tissue resolution, and multi-parametric analysis capabilities. MRI can not only display the anatomical structure of the transplanted organs in detail but also dynamically monitor the blood perfusion and tissue oxygenation levels of the transplanted organs through advanced imaging techniques, such as arterial spin labeling (ASL) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) imaging. The application of these new technologies helps to discover complications early and provides important diagnostic information, thereby improving patient prognosis. Therefore, this study aims to explore the application of MRI in the functional assessment of transplanted organs after SPK, especially its potential in the early diagnosis and monitoring of organ dysfunction. Through this study, we hope to provide a new non-invasive diagnostic method for the early discovery of post-SPK complications, thereby improving the long-term prognosis of patients and filling the gap in current clinical practice.",NO,Simultaneous Pancreas-Kidney Transplantation,,"Diffusion sequence measures cell parameters, The patient reaches CKD stage 5 and the glomerular filtration rate is less than 15 ml/min, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 120 months",,,Zhen Li,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,500,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,TJ-IRB202409057,2025-12-20,2030-09-17,2030-12-12,2025-06-03,,2025-06-03,"Tongji hospital, NO.1095 jiefang avenue,, Wuhan, Hubei, 430074, China",

A key hypothesis suggests that RLS symptoms are linked to abnormal brain function in processing internally generated stimuli, particularly interoception. This distorted perception of the internal bodily state leads to maladaptive behaviors, which may manifest across a wide range of medical and psychiatric disorders. Here, the investigators hypothesize that dysfunction in the insular cortex (IC) may result in a failure of behavioral adaptation, primarily expressed as an urge to move the legs and hyperarousal, even when the body and mind need rest.

NCT07001878,Cannabis Potency Effects on Brain White Matter in Early Phase Psychosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07001878,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Canada reports some of the highest rates of cannabis use in our youth and young adult populations, among all the developed countries. Recent Health Canada surveys report that 27% of 16-19-year-olds and 32% of 20-24-year-olds have used cannabis in the past 30 days, with 16-24-year-olds showing the highest rates of daily or near-daily use. Unfortunately, cannabis use has also been found to be a risk factor for the development of a psychotic disorder in emerging adults, and in those who develop psychosis and continue cannabis use, there is a significant effect on long term outcomes. This includes the severity of symptoms, risks of relapse (being hospitalized) and not reaching a level of functioning that would be expected. Lifetime experience with cannabis is greater than 80% in young adults with early phase psychosis (EPP; the first 5 years of a psychosis illness) with up to 30% of Canadian EPP patients meeting criteria for a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder (CUD) at entry to care. A recent Canadian population-based study found that cannabis use disorder associated to psychosis has risen from 3.7% pre-2018 to 10.3% at present. There has been a significant increase in Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels in cannabis products available globally over the years, with popular cannabis products available start as high as 18% THC in Canada. However high potency cannabis carries a more significant risk for psychosis development, as well as higher risk for cannabis dependence and other severe mental health issues.

A major gap in the research is a specific focus on cannabis potency on brain white matter (WM) in youth and young adults, and if there are any potential treatment strategies that could be used to influence any of these cannabis WM effects. To address this, a medication called metformin, that is already used in psychosis to help with side effects of antipsychotic medications, will be used as it has also shown promise to influence WM changes in other illnesses. This project is thus focused on naturalistic cannabis potency effects on WM in emerging adults in EPP (divided into three groups; those using high potency cannabis, low potency cannabis, and minimal cannabis use) and treating them with metformin for 6 months and assessing effects on neuroimaging, cognitive and clinical variables.

The purpose of this pilot feasibility study is to inform the development/refinement of an intervention protocol, and not to test potential effects or mechanisms as the sample size will have insufficient power to perform an in-depth analysis. The results of this work will inform our research strategy development and assess feasibility of our novel methodological approach.

NCT07001852,EnDOvascular Therapy for Late WiNdow IschEmic Stroke Patients Selected bY AutoMatic Plain ComputErized Tomography,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07001852,DONE SYMPLE,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The DONE SYMPLE Trial is a global clinical study testing whether a procedure called endovascular therapy, which removes blood clots from blocked brain arteries, can safely benefit more stroke patients when used up to 72 hours after symptoms begin. Endovacular Therapy is already proven to improve recovery in patients treated within 6 hours, but only when advanced imaging like Computed Tomography (CT) perfusion or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is available to guide treatment. Unfortunately, many hospitals, specially in underserved areas, do not have access to this type of imaging.

This trial will investigate whether a basic brain scan called non-contrast CT, which is widely available in hospitals around the world, can be used instead. Special software will automatically analyze the CT scan to help doctors decide if a patient has enough brain tissue left to save with Endovascular Therapy. If this simpler approach works, it could expand access to lifesaving stroke care for more people globally.

The study will enroll 500 adult stroke patients, ages 18 to 80, with a large vessel blockage in the brain's anterior circulation, moderate to severe stroke symptoms, and who are between 6 and 72 hours from when they were last known to be well. All participants will undergo CT imaging analyzed by the automated software. If the scan shows a small core of already damaged brain tissue and a larger area of threatened but still viable brain, the patient will qualify.

Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either standard medical therapy alone or medical therapy plus Endovasculat Therapy which involves inserting a catheter through a blood vessel to reach the brain and using a device to remove the clot. This procedure is performed by trained stroke or neurointerventional specialists. The study is ""open-label,"" meaning patients and doctors know which treatment is given, but the assessment of patient recovery will be done by independent reviewers who do not know the group assignments.

The primary goal is to determine if patients who receive Endovascular Therapy have better recovery at 90 days, measured by a scale called the modified Rankin Scale, which assesses how much disability a patient has after a stroke. The trial will also look at safety (especially brain bleeding after treatment), size and growth of brain injury on follow-up scans, recovery of strength and language, and overall quality of life and survival. Imaging will be reviewed centrally by a specialized team, and results will be analyzed to see how well Endovascular Therapy performs using this new patient selection method.

The DONE SYMPLE Trial is sponsored by the University of Iowa in collaboration with the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston. It will take place at up to 20 hospitals worldwide. All patients will be followed closely with exams and imaging at specific time points up to 90 days after treatment.

If successful, this trial could change stroke care around the world by proving that Endovascular Therapy can be used safely and effectively even without advanced imaging, using tools available in most hospitals.

NCT07001748,Testing the Addition of Paclitaxel Administered Into the Abdominal Cavity Combined With Chemotherapy for Patients With Gastric Cancer Spread to the Abdominal Cavity,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07001748,STOPGAP II,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"This study is being done to answer the following questions:

Can we lower the chance of your gastric cancer from growing or spreading by administering paclitaxel chemotherapy directly into your abdominal cavity in addition to chemotherapy given through a vein in your arm? Will administering paclitaxel chemotherapy directly into your abdominal cavity, in addition to chemotherapy given through a vein in your arm help you live longer? We are doing this study because we want to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for your gastric cancer. The usual approach is defined as care most people get for gastric cancer.

If you decide to take part in this study, you will first receive a surgical procedure called a diagnostic laparoscopy. This will help the study doctors learn more about your gastric cancer. Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive surgery for which you will be placed under general anesthesia. Then the surgeon will make small incisions (5mm) on your belly through which a camera and thin instruments are introduced to evaluate the abdomen. This procedure takes about 1 hour to complete. Your study group will be assigned during the surgery. The study groups are described further in the 'What are the study groups?' section below.

If you are placed into the study group 1, you will not have an intraperitoneal port (a small device which is placed under the skin and fat of your upper abdomen and a tube that is placed into the abdomen).

If you are placed into the study group 2, you will have an intraperitoneal port placed. The reason is that in addition to standard chemotherapy, which is given through a vein in your arm, this port will be used to deliver the medication paclitaxel directly inside your abdomen when you are ready to start study treatment.

It is important to know that you will not know your study group until after the surgery is over. This is because information that is learned during the surgery will help determine which study group you are put in.

Once you have fully healed from this surgery, you will start study treatment. Depending on which study group you are assigned, you will either receive a standard chemotherapy regimen (the regimen will be chosen by you and your doctor) if you are in study group 1, or paclitaxel through a tube in your belly plus chemotherapy given through a vein in your arm if you are in study group 2. All participants will get treatment for three (3) months after which you will undergo reevaluation. If the disease is under control or responding to treatment, you may continue the assigned treatment until your disease gets worse, the side effects become too severe, or you may be offered a surgical procedure to remove the cancer if the amount of disease is low and can be completely removed as determined by a surgeon.

There is a very small chance that during the laparoscopy surgical procedure, the doctor might find something called ""intra-abdominal adhesions"". These are areas where the stomach has healed previously and created scar tissue. If this scar tissue prevents the surgeon from being able to place a port in the correct area, you would be ineligible to receive the study treatment. If this happens, you may still receive standard of care therapy after your surgery, but you will not be able to continue on the study. If you have more questions about this, you can ask your surgeon or the study team to help.

After you finish your study treatment, your doctor or study team will watch you for side effects. They will continue to follow your condition every three (3) months during the first two (2) years, then every six (6) months until year 5.

At 50% information time, futility test using Wieand rule would be conducted. If the study results show promising results for the investigational arm and reject the null hypothesis at interim efficacy analysis, the study will proceed to investigate Phase III portion without having a pause in accrual before starting Phase III. Otherwise, if the study is not futile at 50% information time (HR\>1), then the study will proceed and wait for the data to reach 100% information, meaning that the study will wait until the data is mature for Phase II analysis (projected to wait 12 months after end of the accrual to collect 58 PFS events)., From randomization to progression or death without documentation of progression, assessed up to 5 years.|Overall survival (Phase III), For the Phase III portion, a futility interim analysis is planned at 50% information time, projected to occur 4.3 years after study activation. However, because of the potential one year pause before starting Phase III portion, the futility interim analysis may occur early. Similar to the Phase II portion, the interim analysis for futility would use the Wieand rule to make sure the investigational arm is not doing worse than the control arm.

Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and implement a remote, asynchronous, eight-module psychoeducation programme (Tobacco Addiction Support System (TÜBSİS) = Tobacco Addiction Psychological Support Programme) based on mindfulness psychological intervention with a web-based, online platform-supported application for male and female individuals over the age of 18 with tobacco use. The TÜBSİS Programme, which is an individual intervention, was applied to male and female tobacco users at a university via a web platform.

Method: In this randomised controlled study, data collection from the participants in the intervention group was carried out through the web-based platform of the TÜBSİS Programme. Data collection from the participants in the control group was carried out via Google Forms and Google E-mail (Gmail). The participants were asked questions including the intervention variables three times in total, at the beginning, after two weeks and after four weeks. The participants in the intervention and control groups were asked about sociodemographic characteristics and tobacco use characteristics at baseline. Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) Model Change Question Form, Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, Fagerström Nicotine Dependence Test and Informed Consent Form were applied to both groups at the beginning, in the middle and at the end of the intervention study.

This, together with the traumatic experiences during a hospitalization, can lead to the development of posttraumatic stress reactions. As the stress can trigger painful episodes (pain crisis) in children with sickle cell disease, the investigators think that treating these stress symptoms can reduce the pain-related problems in their lives. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is proven to be an effective trauma treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder. Research studies show that EMDR can reduce pain in adults. The investigators want to study now if EMDR effective is in reducing pain-related problems in children with sickle cell disease.",NO,"Sickle Cell Disease|Pain|Pain, Chronic Disease",OTHER: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR),"Pain interference, The PROMIS Short Form - Pain Interference 8a for measuring Pain Interference will be used. The PROMIS Pain Interference questionnaire assesses the pain impact on relevant aspects of one's life. This includes the extent to which pain affects social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. It also incorporates items probing sleep and enjoyment in life. The questionnaire assesses pain interference over the past seven days (recall period). A higher PROMIS T-score represents more pain interference. This scale ranges from 0 to 100 points. In his dissertation, Luijten reports that the general Dutch pediatric population reports a mean score of 39 points with a standard deviation of 10 points. Therefore, T-scores of 49 and above represent a (sub)clinical level of functioning.

The Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS) questionnaire is a screening instrument based on the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for PTSD. It measures potentially traumatic events and PTSD symptoms (PTSS). The questionnaire consists of 15 items measuring traumatic events, 20 items measuring DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, and 5 items measuring psychosocial functioning, and it is administered in approximately 15 minutes. The 4-point symptom response scales indicate the reported frequency/severity of each symptom.

For children aged 6-7 years, using the caregiver-report version, the possible score range is 0-48, and the recommended cut-off point indicative of (sub)clinically relevant levels of symptoms is 12 points or more.

Somatic symptoms (changes in appetite, sleeping patterns) are not included, which eliminates consideration of these item's confounding effects when assessing children with comorbid physical conditions. The questionnaires are universal rather than disease-specific, making scores easily comparable to the general population. They assess depressive symptoms over the past seven days (recall period).

The study will involve three dose levels, with three to six patients enrolled at each level.

vvDD-hIL2 is a genetically modified vaccinia virus, derived from the virus previously used for smallpox vaccination. The modification is intended to target and destroy tumors while minimizing harm to healthy tissues by stimulating the body's immune response.

Participants will receive an injection of vvDD-hIL2 directly into their abdominal tumors at AHN West Penn. The study team will monitor for side effects and assess tumor response to the treatment.

Active participation will last up to two months, involving seven clinic visits and approximately four lab visits at AHN West Penn Hospital. Visits will include standard of care procedures as well as study-specific tests and exams. Most visits will last one to two hours, with some extending to two to three hours. The drug administration day will require a twelve-hour visit.

Effectiveness and side effects will be evaluated through blood draws, oral swabs, urinalysis and tissue biopsies. Tissue samples will be used for genomic analysis and stored for potential future research. Data collected may also be used for future research purposes.

The Effect of Evening Technology Use with Calming vs. Exciting Content on Sleep Architecture in Older Adults: A Crossover Randomized Controlled Trial

Background

The study explores how evening use of digital devices with different types of content (calming vs. exciting) affects sleep in older adults. While technology's effects on sleep have been studied in younger populations, its specific impacts on older adults remain under-researched. This study fills that gap by focusing on subjective and objective sleep measures.

Objectives and Research Questions

Objective: Compare the effects of calming digital content, exciting digital content, and non-digital activities on sleep architecture.

NCT07001358,The Rufaida Project: Researching the Impact of Ramadan Fasting on the Gut and Vaginal Microbiome,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07001358,Rufaida,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"The body's systems are deeply connected, but they are often studied separately. A recent large-scale citizen-science project on women's health, called Isala, discovered a group of gut-related bacteria present in the vaginal microbiome. This finding supports the idea that gut and vaginal bacteria interact closely, a connection known as the gut-vagina axis. However, it remains unclear whether changes in gut bacteria influence the vaginal microbiome.

This discovery led to an exploration of how diet affects both the gut and vaginal microbiomes. In the gut, bacteria rely on carbohydrates from food, while in the vagina, bacteria feed on glycogen, a sugar stored in the vaginal lining. This glycogen is broken down into smaller sugars, which beneficial Lactobacillus bacteria use for fermentation. Since starch is a major source of these sugars, researchers suspect that a starch-rich diet may support Lactobacillus growth, which in turn promotes vaginal health.

To test this hypothesis, the Rufaida Project was launched. Ramadan is characterised by a fasting period of approximately one month during which participants abstain from eating between sunrise and sunset. Ramadan provides a unique opportunity to study how fasting affects the microbiome under controlled conditions.

In this study, 50 Muslim women will be asked to provide vaginal and stool samples at eight predetermined time points-before, during, and after Ramadan. These samples will be analysed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine bacterial composition. Comparative analysis will be conducted between samples across different time points and anatomical sites. The objective is to understand how fasting and dietary changes influence the gut and vaginal microbiomes, and whether gut bacteria play a role in shaping vaginal health. Additionally, participants will complete weekly health questionnaires. An additional study group of up to 300 Muslim women will complete weekly questionnaires without providing biological samples.

Bacterial community composition will be determined using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing by Illumina MiSeq analysis. Bioinformatic tools will be employed to assess taxonomic profiles across different time points and anatomical sites. Particular attention will be given to correlations between gut- and vaginal-associated microbial taxa, with the aim of identifying bacterial signatures potentially shaped by dietary changes and fasting patterns.

NCT07001215,Effect of CPAP Versus APAP in Patients With Obesity Undergoing Bariatric Surgery Protocol,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07001215,ObesAOS,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Introduction Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder in obese patients, especially those undergoing bariatric surgery. OSA is characterized by upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. Obesity and OSA are closely related conditions that can exacerbate each other. Positive airway pressure therapy is essential for managing OSA, but adherence to therapy can be challenging, particularly in patients who experience rapid physiological changes after bariatric surgery.

Objective This study aims to determine whether automatic positive airway pressure therapy (APAP) improves nightly usage hours compared to continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Secondary objectives include evaluating the percentage of nights with therapy use over 4 hours, reduction of the residual apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), changes in daytime sleepiness, pressure requirements, side effects, sleep-related quality of life, reduction in in-person visits, and optimization of healthcare resources.

Methodology A randomized, parallel-group, open-label, controlled clinical trial will be conducted. Adult patients eligible for bariatric surgery with a diagnosis of moderate to severe OSA (AHI \> 15) requiring positive pressure therapy will be included. Participants will be randomized to receive either APAP or CPAP. Follow-up will be conducted over 12 months after surgery, with assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months. Data will be collected on treatment adherence, residual AHI, OSA symptoms, daytime sleepiness, quality of life, and treatment costs.

APAP therapy is expected to improve nightly usage hours compared to CPAP. It is also expected that APAP will show better adaptation to changing pressure needs after bariatric surgery. Data will be analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of both therapies.

This study will provide evidence on the efficacy of APAP compared to CPAP in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The results will help optimize the treatment of OSA in this population and improve patients' quality of life. Additionally, the study is expected to contribute to the optimization of healthcare resources by reducing in-person visits and repeated sleep studies.",NO,"Sleep Apnea, Obstructive|Bariatric Surgery|Obesity|Treatment Adherence and Compliance|Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)","DEVICE: In the intervention group, patients will be treated with auto-adjusting APAP, providing variable pressures throughout the sleep hours.|DEVICE: CPAP","APAP vs. CPAP: Impact on Nightly Usage in Obese Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery, To determine whether APAP therapy increases nightly usage hours compared to CPAP therapy in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery., Obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery will be evaluated during the 3 months prior to surgery and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively in patients with OSA undergoing bariatric surgery.","Therapy Adherence Over Time, To measure and compare the percentage of nights with therapy usage exceeding 4 hours in both groups (APAP and fixed CPAP), 3 months before bariatric surgery and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively.|Reduction in Residual AHI, To evaluate the reduction in the residual Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) in both groups, 3 months before bariatric surgery and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively.|Daytime Sleepiness, To assess changes in daytime sleepiness using validated scales (e.g., Epworth Sleepiness Scale) in both groups., 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively|Pressure Requirement Trends, To evaluate changes in pressure requirements in both groups over time, (3 months pre-surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively).|Pressure Adaptability of APAP, To determine whether APAP shows greater adaptability to changes in pressure needs compared to fixed CPAP., 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively|Side Effects Monitoring, To measure and compare the presence of side effects (e.g., nasal dryness, skin irritation) in both groups, (3 months pre-surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively).|Sleep-Related Quality of Life, To assess sleep-related quality of life using validated questionnaires (e.g., Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and EuroQol-5D) in both groups., (3 months pre-surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively).|Reduction in Outpatient Visits, To analyze the potential reduction in outpatient clinic visits in the APAP group compared to the CPAP group, (3 months pre-surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively).|Healthcare Resource Optimization, To evaluate the optimization of healthcare resources through the reduction of repeated sleep studies., (3 months pre-surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively).|STOP-BANG Questionnaire Accuracy, To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the STOP-BANG questionnaire for detecting OSA in bariatric patients, and to determine whether a new cutoff point is needed to optimize its performance in this population., (3 months pre-surgery and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively).",,Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal,Fundacion para la Investigacion Biomedica del Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,104,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,HURamonyCajal,2025-09-15,2027-09-15,2028-09-15,2025-06-03,,2025-06-03,"Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal,, Madrid, 28034, Spain",

In Chile, previous studies have shown high rates of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal risk in this population. This study seeks to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based intervention for the indicated prevention of suicidality in undergraduate students, and also to explore its impact on reducing suicidal ideation. A quasi-experimental before-and-after design will be used with a sample of students from the Universidad de los Andes who present mild to moderate suicidal risk. As this is a pilot study, a sample size calculation is not required, but we expect to recruit 20 subjects, which will allow us to conduct acceptability and feasibility assessments and collect data for a larger-scale study. A follow-up will consist of repeating the initial assessment questionnaire, which will be completed two and four months after the intervention. The methodology includes an initial interview to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria, signing informed consent, and developing a safety plan with the students. Following this, six weekly sessions (three in-person and three with digital components) of 60 minutes each will be held, focusing on emotional regulation, cognitive restructuring, and problem-solving. The intervention will be facilitated by trained psychologists, under the supervision of a trained psychologist or psychiatrist. To assess acceptability, the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) will be primarily used.

To assess outcomes, validated instruments will be applied, such as the Columbia Suicide Risk Scale (C-SSRS), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) for anxiety symptoms, the Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12) for quality of life, the Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS) for stress tolerance, the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences-Positive (CAPE-P15) for psychotic symptoms, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS-E) for emotional regulation, the Social Problem-Solving Inventory-Revised (SPSI-R) for problem-solving, and the Cognitive-behavioural Therapy Skills Questionnaire (CBTSQ) for cognitive-behavioral skills. Reduction in suicidal ideation, satisfaction with the intervention, and program adherence will be measured.

The study hopes that the prevention program, along with the proposed assessments and procedures, will be appropriate and feasible in a university setting.

The scale is constructed of 15 items, divided into four subscales that measure four factors: Tolerance (items 1, 3, and 5), understood as the perceived ability to handle strong emotions; Relief (items 2, 4, and 15), considered as ""how relieved a person feels when they experience a strong emotion""; Evaluation (items 6, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12), understood as the person's perceived ability to accept their strong emotions; and, Regulation (items 8, 13 and 14), understood as the effort that a person makes to manage their intense emotions openly. DTS is a scale designed to be self-administered that is answered using a type format., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|The Cognitive-behavioral Therapy Skills Questionnaire (CBTSQ), Evaluates which components of Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) appear to be most active. This scale originally has 16 items that measures two skills: cognitive restructuring (CR) and behavioral activation (BA). Respondents rate each item on a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 (I don't do this) to 5 (I always do this). Both scales have good reliability (CR: α=0.88; BA: α=0.85). Two items refer to evaluating aspects related to a disease or treatment. Since cognitive-behavioral skills are evaluated in this study, these two items of the questionnaire are included, leaving an instrument of 14 items. In a study whose publication is under review with adolescents between 15 and 18 years old, using the 14-item instrument, it was found that the reliability was α=0.77 and ω=0.78 for BA and α=0, 80 and ω=0.81 for CR. The minimum score would be 14 and the maximum would be 70. A higher score on the CBTSQ indicates greater competence and use of cognitive behavioral therapy skills., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Community Assessment of Psychotic Experiences Scale (CAPE-P15), This is a 15-item self-report instrument. Item responses range from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). The scale assesses three domains: paranoid ideation (PI, 5 items), bizarre experiences (EB, 7 items), and perceptual anomalies (AP, 3 items). Scores can range from 15 to 75. Higher scores indicate greater severity of Psychotic Experiences. All items are averaged for an overall measure of the trait being assessed. In a validation study of a Chilean population of adolescents between 13 and 18 years of age, the trifactorial nature of the scale was confirmed. Internal reliability for these factors was 0.779 for PI; 0.839 for EB; and 0.884 for AP., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Brief Problem Solving Inventory (SPSI-R), This is a 25-item self-report instrument that measures two adaptive problem-solving dimensions (positive problem orientation and rational problem solving) and three dysfunctional dimensions (negative problem orientation, impulsive/careless style, and avoidant style).

This instrument measures variables such as emotional dyscontrol, daily life interference, emotional inattention, emotional confusion, and emotional rejection. The Spanish-adapted version of the DERS, originally developed by Gratz and Roemer (2004), contains 28 items distributed across five subscales, compared to the original version's 36 items and six subscales. Items are rated using a five-point Likert scale (1 = almost never, 5 = almost always), where higher scores indicate greater difficulties in emotion regulation. The psychometric properties of the DERS-E show adequate internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha ranging from = 0.71 to 0.73, and good test-retest reliability over a six-month period (ρ = 0.74, p \< 0.001)., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|12-item Short-Form Health Survey, The SF-12 is an instrument that assesses quality of life and general health status.

Response options follow a Likert-type scale (with the number of options ranging from three to six points, depending on the item), which assess the intensity and/or frequency of the person's health status. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life.

The first section includes seven questions related to pain characteristics and sensory information obtained through patient interview. These questions are about burning, electric shocks, coldness, tingling, pricking, numbness, and itching. The second section contains three statements related to physical examination (touch hypoesthesia, pinprick hypoesthesia, and allodynia). For each statement, ""yes"" or ""no"" responses are given. A score of ""1"" is assigned for ""yes"" answers and ""0"" for ""no"" answers, and the scores are summed.

While the SF-36 is used for chronic conditions (states), the SF-12 is used for short-term assessments (clinical findings). Similarly, it is also used to gather information about the patient's general health status. The SF-12 provides the same summary component scores as the SF-36, but with fewer items, making it a significant advantage due to its shorter application time. The scale asks the patient about their health opinions, how they feel, and how easily they can perform their usual activities. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life., 3 months|QUICK-DASH, QUICK-DASH (Shoulder, Arm, and Hand Problems Questionnaire):

NCT07001085,ctDNA Monitoring in Patients With HCC and mCRC,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07001085,,RECRUITING,"""Liquid biopsy"" is a collective term that refers to the analysis of cancer-derived biomarkers isolated from the biological fluids of cancer patients. The analysis of these blood components can be used for early cancer detection, staging, prognosis, drug resistance monitoring, and minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. The ""liquid biopsy"" is based on the fact that cancer cells release their DNA into the bloodstream, known as ctDNA (circulating tumor DNA). A sample of the patient's peripheral blood is sufficient to test ctDNA. There have been many studies in the literature on the usefulness of liquid biopsy in the treatment of various malignancies, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. However, this has been a lack of prospectively obtained data analyzing the impact on the ctDNA assessment of the progression and recurrence of the primary disease or the type of treatment applied to improve long-term survival. The ctDNA test is not a widely recognized technology for assessing the progression of neoplastic disease.

Aim of the study/research hypothesis: the aim of the project is to clinically validate the value of the ctDNA test as a tool for early diagnosis of recurrence, assessment of cancer progression, the prognosis of treatment effects, and monitoring of therapy in patients with primary liver HCC or colorectal cancer metastases.

Description of the methodology: The main objective of the work will be achieved through the implementation of specific objectives: 1) Recruitment of 300 patients, including 100 patients with colorectal liver limited metastasis, 100 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 100 patients in the control group who will be qualified for liver resection or transplantation, and in whom ctDNA level testing will not be tested. 2) Taking blood samples from the patients. The detection of ctDNA requires only the collection of 10 ml of the patient's blood and the collection of specimens from the tumor after resection. Blood will be collected before, one month, and 6 months after surgery during routine oncology check-ups. Tumor specimens will be taken from the backside table and sent for final histopathological examination. Control ""follow-up"" will take place for 18 months from the first ctDNA blood collection.

Based on the collected material, genetic analysis will be performed. In the first stage, a tumor section taken during liver resection, and DNA from the patient's blood will be analyzed the molecular (genetic) signature of the patient's tumor will be determined and several genetic changes characteristic of the change will be selected. Thereafter, the presence of the selected genetic variants will be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively in the pre-operative blood sample and all subsequent post-operative blood samples.

The investigators assume that in a blood sample taken 4 weeks after surgery, ctDNA should be undetectable or detected at a low level. In order to assess the change in the level of ctDNA in the postoperative period, a third examination will be performed - 6 months after the operation. Any level of detected ctDNA will be considered significant.

Each increase in the level of the analyzed mutations will indicate the potential progression of the disease. The results of molecular analyzes will be correlated with the assessment of imaging tests and the level of tumor markers performed as part of routine oncological control.

This is a prospective observational study with a defined study group. These are patients with colorectal cancer metastases limited to the liver, i.e. stage IV of the cancer process, or patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) qualified for radical surgery or liver transplantation. Patients in the control group (without ctDNA tests) will be treated in accordance with the best clinical knowledge and accepted international recommendations.

The statistical analysis of the results will use the SAS (Statistical Analysis System) software, considering the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank tests, Cox proportional hazards regression, and logistic regression.

The investigators hypothesize that the use of ctDNA will enable the identification of early disease progression or will identify patients with the highest risk of recurrence. In addition, it will improve the supervision of diseases and enable possible modification of treatment in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer or patients after liver resection or transplantation for HCC. In the future, oncological prevention will consist in blood tests, which will enable early detection of even those cancers that show symptoms only at an advanced stage, which will potentially improve the effectiveness of treatment.",NO,HCC - Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Colorectal Cancer Metastatic,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Tumor Tissue Collection and NGS|OTHER: Blood Collection for Plasma ctDNA|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ctDNA Mutation Analysis via ddPCR,"Assessment of the clinical value of ctDNA level, Assessment of the ctDNA concentration one day before surgery., One day before surgery - first day of enrollment|Assessment of the clinical value of ctDNA level, Assessment of the ctDNA concentration one month after surgery, From enrollment to 30 days after a surgery.|Assessment of the clinical value of ctDNA level, Assessment of the ctDNA concentration 6 months after surgery., From enrollment to 6 months after a surgery.|Assessment of the mutational status of patient cancer, Determining the mutation status of the patient's cancer tissue by performing next-generation sequencing, From enrollment to 6 months after a surgery.|Assessment of the mutational status of patient cancer, Determining the mutation status of the patient's cancer by performing ddPCR reaction., From enrollment to 6 months after a surgery.|Assessment of the mutational status of patient cancer 30 days after surgery, Determination of mutation status in plasma, 30 days after the patient's surgery by performing ddPCR reaction.

Task-focused training is an approach that relies on multiple repetitions of motor performance. Virtual reality is a technology that combines computer graphics to create a realistic world that responds to the user's responses.

Purpose: The study was planned to observe the effect of virtual reality training on balance, walking and fatigue and to compare it with task-oriented training.

Materials and Methods: The study, designed as a randomized controlled study, will include individuals with multiple sclerosis between the ages of 20-65. The population of the study consists of individuals with MS at Elazig Private Ada Special Education and Rehabilitation Center. Individuals who agree to participate in the study and meet the inclusion criteria will be selected by trying to reach the entire relevant population and will be divided into three groups using the sealed envelope method. Individuals will be evaluated before treatment and at the 8th week after treatment. One of the experimental groups will receive task-oriented training in the clinic 3 days a week, 40 minutes a day for 8 weeks, virtual reality training will be applied to the other, and conventional training will be applied to the control group. Expanded disability status scale to evaluate physical disability; balance assessment berg balance scale; gait assessment rivermead visual gait assessment scale; Fatigue assessment will be evaluated using the fatigue severity scale.

Result: The effects of task-oriented and virtual reality training groups on balance, walking and fatigue will be interpreted by comparing the evaluation results before and after the treatment program.

Unique Value: The study will contribute to the literature as it is the first study comparing the superiority of virtual reality training over task-oriented education in individuals with multiple sclerosis and the superiority of virtual reality training and task-oriented education over conventional education.

NCT07000942,Diagnostic Electrical Cardioversion for Explaining Patient's AF and HF Symptoms,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07000942,DEEP-AF-HF,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Rationale:

The co-existence of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and Heart Failure (HF) is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and hospital admissions, significantly contributing to healthcare burden. Patients often experience overlapping symptoms, complicating identifying the disease primarily responsible for symptom burden. Electrical cardioversion (ECV) has been suggested to assess symptom status in sinus rhythm. However, the role of a diagnostic ECV in patients with AF and concomitant HF has not been established.

The hypothesis of this trial is that a diagnostic ECV can provide insight into AF-specific and HF-specific symptoms that can inform the physician and subsequently lead to treatment changes, as well as improve quality of life (QoL), and result changes in ejection fraction, cardiac output, and NT-proBNP levels.

Objective: To assess whether a diagnostic ECV results in more treatment changes after 3 months, compared to standard of care (no ECV).

Study design: This is an investigator initiated, randomized, open label with blinded endpoint evaluation, multi-centre, trial.

Study population: 112 patients with chronic HF and ECG confirmed persistent AF.

Trial intervention: Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either an ECV or standard of care with pharmacological rate and/or rhythm control.

Main study parameters/endpoints:

The primary outcome: total number of treatment alterations by the physician during 3 months post intervention/randomization.

Secondary outcomes: Success rate of ECV, recurrences of AF at 4 weeks, QoL changes assessed by AFEQT and KCCQ score, echocardiographic changes (left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and cardiac output (CO)), and laboratory changes (NT-proBNP) between baseline (pre-cardioversion) and 4 weeks (post-cardioversion). Whether the physician can distinguish AF from HF symptoms and whether ECV can be used as diagnostic tool.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Since this is a pragmatic trial, the study will be embedded within care according to current AF and HF guidelines, that includes ECV and rhythm and/or rate control, while acknowledging wide variability in local practises. The patients in the intervention arm will undergo a diagnostic ECV. Both groups will fill out questionnaires regarding QoL (baseline and 4 weeks) and have an echocardiogram at 4 weeks.

Although CBT is known to effectively reduce OCD symptoms, exactly how it changes brain activity remains unclear. This study aims to measure the effects of CBT on brain function using electroencephalography (EEG), a safe, non-invasive way to monitor brain activity.

Participants diagnosed with OCD will be randomly assigned to two groups. One group will receive CBT consisting of 12 individual therapy sessions, held weekly, lasting about 50 minutes each. The other group will not receive therapy during the study but will be offered treatment afterward. Brain activity and psychological well-being will be measured three times: before starting treatment, immediately after completing CBT, and again three months later.

In clinical settings, many cases of lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) are closely associated with abnormal conditioned reflexes formed in the central nervous system during the urine storage or voiding phases. Relaxation, as a core physiological and psychological state, has been shown to promote effective urine storage and facilitate smooth voiding. By repeatedly training individuals to establish a new conditioned reflex linking the sensation of urinary urgency with a state of relaxation, it may be possible to improve bladder storage capacity and voiding function. Based on this concept, we have developed the world's first Micturition Desire-Relaxation Training Device (Chinese Patent No.: ZL 2020 1 0397789.4).

Mucosal Associated Invariant T cells are a population of unconventional T cells which are enriched in mucosal tissues such as the lung and gut but are also present in other tissues including the skin, adipose tissue and the liver \[4,5,6,7\]. Unlike conventional T cells, MAIT cells are not restricted by MHC but recognize the MHC-related protein MR1. MAIT cells express a semi-invariant TCR α-chain (Vα7.2-Jα33/20/12 in humans) and a limited repository of TCR-β chains, mostly from the TRBV20 and TRBV6 gene families \[8,9\]

MAIT cells can also be activated independent of TCR engagement, via pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-18 \[10,11,12\]. Upon activation, MAIT cells can rapidly respond, producing a milieu of cytokines including interferon-gamma , tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-17 \[11,14\]. MAIT cell cytokine profiles can vary depending on their tissue localization \[15\].

Peripheral MAIT cells are potent producers of IFNγ and TNFα, whereas IL-17 producing MAIT cells are rare in the periphery but are more abundant in, for example, the female genital mucosa \[16\]. In addition to cytokine production, A central role in immune protection against cancer is played by T lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ T cells .Their infiltration in tumor cell nests is usually associated with a favorable prognosis and may predict outcome of therapies with drugs that block immune inhibitory receptors (checkpoint blockade.

A recent meta-analysis reported that tumor-infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes can be identified in 48% of all breast cancers .Interestingly, triple-negative breast cancers show the highest incidence of lymphocyte predominance. Moreover, TILs were found to be prognostic in triple-negative breast cancer, and higher levels of TILs were predictive for trastuzumab benefit in HER2+ disease. These findings suggest that therapies that enforce immune responses could potentially improve patient survival.",NO,Breast Cancer,,"Relation between mucosal associated invariant t lymphocytes and breast cancer outcome, The role of mucosal associated invariant t lymphocytes in breast cancer, Baseline",,,Assiut University,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,74,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,MAIT Cells in Breast Cancer,2025-12-01,2026-08-01,2026-12-01,2025-06-02,,2025-06-02,,
NCT07000383,Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Gelsectan in the Treatment of Diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07000383,GELIBS,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"This clinical study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of Gelsectan, a treatment containing xyloglucan, in adults diagnosed with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) in Vietnam. IBS-D is a common digestive disorder that causes frequent diarrhea along with abdominal pain and bloating, significantly affecting patients' daily life and wellbeing.

The main goal of the study is to determine whether Gelsectan can reduce the severity of symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and bloating, and improve patients' quality of life. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either Gelsectan alone, Gelsectan combined with an antispasmodic medication, or antispasmodic medication alone. The treatment will last for two months, with regular monitoring of symptom changes and any side effects.

The investigators hypothesize that Gelsectan treatment will lead to better symptom relief and quality of life compared to standard antispasmodic treatment. The study will also carefully observe the safety profile of Gelsectan during the treatment period.

Results from this study will provide important information about the potential benefits and risks of Gelsectan for Vietnamese patients with IBS-D and may contribute to improving treatment options for this condition in Vietnam.",NO,Diarrhea-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome|Irritable Bowel Syndrome of Diarrhea Type (IBS-D),DEVICE: Gelsectan|DRUG: Antispasmodic Agent,"Clinical remission of IBS-D symptoms, Defined as the resolution of diarrhea, measured as ≤ 2 bowel movements per day with stool consistency \< 5 on the Bristol Stool Form Scale, assessed at 1 and 2 months after treatment initiation., 1 month and 2 months","Incidence of adverse events, Number and severity of treatment-related and unrelated adverse events reported throughout the 2-month intervention period., Continuous monitoring over 2 months|IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS), The Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) is used to evaluate changes in symptom severity from baseline to Month 1 and Month 2.

NCT07000279,"Assessment of Feasibility, Functionality and Usability of an Hybrid Assistive Exoskeleton for Upper Limb",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07000279,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"People affected by stroke or brachial plexus injuries experience huge impairment in using upper limbs for everyday life activities. Brachial plexus is responsible of sensory-motor innervation of the whole upper limb, the shoulder and also a part of the chest. The majority of such injuries is caused by traumatic events that involve young and healty people in most cases and motor impairment varies together with either the type (complete or incomplete) or the site of injury. It follows the need to realize devices capable of restoring people everyday life independence.

To assist these patients, the most common solutions are passive ortheses that give support to shoulder and forearm without actively enhancing limb functionalities. MyoPro (by MIT, Myomo1) is the only active device available for elbow and wrist, even not completely proven for everyday life yet. It comes from scientific evidences that gravity compensation and functional electrical stimulation (FES) are considerable techniques for rehabilitation of brachial plexus injuries and post-stroke patients. According to the most recent results, hybrid systems that combine FES with robotic joints seem to give interesting benefits in such the contexts taken into account.

The goal of this clinical trial is to assess feasibility, functionality and usability of a new assistive, hybrid, active and portable orthesis for upper limb aimed at improving motor functionality of brachial plexus injuries patients. Complying with weight and size requirements, the device under investigation is designed to assist the whole upper limb with its two modules: a robotic exoskeleton to actively give assistance to shoulder and elbow and a FES module to assist wrist and hand.

The main points the clinical trial aims to address concern:

* number and type of adverse events (device failures and malfunctioning, subjects injuries) during use
* evaluation of change in performance with and without the device
* usability and satisfaction after use
* effectiveness

Post-stroke and brachial plexus injuries patients (with Medical Research Council Scale for Muscle Strength equal to or more than 2) will be enrolled and asked to perform the following tasks with and without wearing the device:

* box and block test

This clinical study investigates whether a shorter or longer duration of systemic therapy before local treatment (surgery or radiation) results in better disease control in patients with esophageal or gastric cancer with a limited number of metastases, also known as oligometastases.

Background:

In about 25% of patients with advanced esophageal or gastric cancer, the disease spreads to only a few sites (oligometastatic disease). Prior studies suggest that local treatment after systemic therapy may extend survival in this subgroup. However, it is unclear how long systemic therapy should last before initiating local treatment. The OMEC-5 study aims to clarify this and identify potential biomarkers for treatment response.

Study Design:

Initiated by Amsterdam UMC and UMCU and conducted in multiple hospitals across Europe.

Total of 414 patients to be enrolled.

Duration: \~53 months (35 months enrollment + 18 months follow-up).

Approved by the medical ethics committee at Amsterdam UMC.

Procedure:

Eligibility screening: Includes physical exam, blood tests (incl. circulating tumor cells), medical history review, and confirmation of oligometastases by an expert panel.

Initial treatment: All participants receive 4 months of standard systemic therapy (chemotherapy + immunotherapy and/or targeted therapy depending on tumor markers like HER2 or Claudin 18.2).

Response assessment (Review 1): Imaging and/or laparoscopic examination.

If oligometastases persist and tumors have not progressed, participants are randomized into two groups:

Group A (longer systemic therapy): 4 more months of systemic therapy, then local treatment if disease is stable, followed by 4 months of immunotherapy ± targeted therapy.

Group B (shorter systemic therapy): Immediate local treatment followed by 4 months of systemic therapy, then reassessment and potentially 4 months of immunotherapy ± targeted therapy.

Follow-up: Regular scans and quality-of-life questionnaires (5 times), and periodic blood sampling (4 times).

Treatments Involved:

Chemotherapy: CapOx or FOLFOX

Immunotherapy: nivolumab or pembrolizumab

Targeted therapy: trastuzumab (HER2-positive) or zolbetuximab (Claudin 18.2-positive)

Potential Benefits and Risks:

Patients may benefit from better disease control and a personalized treatment strategy.

Known side effects relate to the standard treatments used (chemo, immuno, targeted therapies), and no extra medical risk is expected beyond routine care.

Possible inconveniences include blood draws, scans, minor surgery (laparoscopy), and time investment.

Data and Sample Handling:

Personal data and tumor/blood samples are coded and securely stored.

Data may be used for future cancer research if the patient consents.

Participants can withdraw at any time.

Confidentiality and Privacy:

Patient data are kept confidential, and participants have rights to access or delete their data. Privacy measures comply with GDPR and Dutch law.

Compensation and Insurance:

Participation is voluntary, with no financial compensation. Standard treatment costs are covered by healthcare insurance.

Various studies had reported that ultrasonographic measurements of inferior vena cava collapsibility index is a good predictor for reflexing the intravascular volume status\[5\]\[6\] , this is non invasive , on the other hand IVC is not easily feasible in obese and pregnant women.

Some studies compared the difference between IVC and IJV as predictor marker for fluid responsiveness and reported that right internal jugular vein distensibility appears to be a surrogate marker for inferior vena cava vein distensibility for evaluating fluid responsiveness.

Almost great percentage of anesthesiologist easily use IJV ultrasonography for catheterization and it is easily feasible in almost all patients, recent studies documented that noninvasive ultrasonographic measurements of internal jagular vein diameter has a role in assessment of intravascular volume status in spontaneously and mechanically breathing patients, Passive leg raising has been shown to be useful in assessing intravascular volume depletion or fluid responsiveness , some studies compared IJV changing in diameter for supine and trendelenburg positions, there is a similar change in IJV diameter will occur with passive leg raising positions , trendelenburg position may be disadvantageous as it impair gas function and cardiac function especially in elderly and obese patients , on the other hand passive leg raising is simpler and more comfortable to the elderly.

NCT06999941,A Real-world Study of Deucravacitinib in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis With Eczematous Features,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06999941,,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"Emerging evidence indicates that psoriasis and eczema can coexist in the same patient, with reported co-prevalence rates ranging from 0.17% to 20%, suggesting that these conditions may represent a disease spectrum-referred to as Psoriasis Eczema (PsEma). Moreover, paradoxical eczema has been observed in approximately 1% to 12.1% of psoriasis patients undergoing biologic therapy, with up to 61% of affected individuals discontinuing treatment due to eczematous flares. These findings underscore an urgent need for therapeutic agents that are efficacious for PsEma.

Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, is known to mediate critical signaling pathways involved in psoriasis pathogenesis, including those of type I interferons, interleukin (IL)-12, and IL-23. Additionally, TYK2 forms heterodimers with other JAK family members-such as JAK1 or JAK2-to transduce signals from cytokines like IL-13 and IL-22, which are centrally implicated in the pathophysiology of eczema. Based on this molecular profile, we hypothesize that TYK2 inhibition may not only avoid inducing eczematous reactions in psoriasis patients but may also alleviate eczematous inflammation by interfering with JAK1(JAK2)/TYK2-mediated IL-13 and IL-22 signaling.

Deucravacitinib, a selective allosteric TYK2 inhibitor, has shown promising results in our clinical practice, demonstrating improvements in both psoriatic and eczematous manifestations among patients with PsEma. This study aims to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of deucravacitinib in PsEma patients over a 16-week treatment period. In parallel, transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood and lesional skin will be performed to elucidate the immunological landscape and molecular signatures underlying PsEma, thereby contributing valuable clinical and mechanistic insights into its diagnosis and management.",NO,Psoriasis|Eczema|JAK Inhibitor,DRUG: Deucravacitinib 6mg po qd,"Percentage of patients with PASI75, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 16 weeks|Change from baseline in PASI, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 16 weeks|Proportion of patients with s-PGA 0 or 1, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 16 weeks","Proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 16 weeks|change of BSA in eczema from baseline, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 16 weeks|Changes from baseline in WI-NRS, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 16 weeks",,Xi Tan,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,50,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,20240924103453152,2025-04-24,2026-08-30,2026-08-30,2025-05-31,,2025-05-31,"Shanghai general hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, Shanghai, 200080, China",

Differentiated service delivery (DSD) is a care model that tailors services based on clients' needs, helping to improve both the quality and efficiency of care.

This hybrid implementation-effectiveness study will test whether an enhanced MM strategy that uses DSD can be successfully carried out and improve health outcomes for mothers and infants. The study will take place at Burnt Forest Sub-District Hospital (BFSDH) in Kenya.

Researchers will ask:

* Can the enhanced MM strategy be delivered as planned and accepted by patients and staff?
* Does the strategy improve clinical outcomes like keeping mothers in PMTCT care, achieving HIV viral suppression, completing infant HIV testing, and preventing HIV transmission to infants? Researchers will compare health outcomes before and after the strategy is introduced at BFSDH, and also compare outcomes at other similar clinics that continue with standard MM services.

Such as (i) Increase in the width of the periodontal ligament area (ii)Increase in the vascularity,vascular permeability and the migration of leukocytes from the vascular plexus and (iii) the increase in number of osteoclasts lining the marginal alveolar bone of the zone of co destruction . Also, the teeth showing increasing mobility exhibit an enhanced rate of periodontal tissue destruction when exposed to experimentally induced periodontitis When trauma from occlusion is the result of alterations in occlusal forces, it is called as primary trauma from occlusion. When it results from the reduced ability of the Periodontal tissues to resist the occlusal forces ,it is known as secondary trauma from occlusion.One of the clinical sign of TFO include presence of Fremitus which means functional tooth mobility.Aggravation of plaque- related inflammatory periodontal disease by trauma from occlusion is still under question.It is unclear whether TFO occurs primarily in periodontitis patients, or bone loss due to periodontitis leads to TFO in later stages. Review of Literature has further revealed that there is no study conducted on anterior teeth with Fremitus and its relation with periodontal parameters.So, it may be hypothesized that TFO may have impact on Periodontal tissue in different age groups as periodontitis is chronic in nature and time of initiation of the disease could not be identified.Periodontitis is chronic in nature and time of initiation of the disease could not be identified. Recently age dependent distribution of periodontitis was studied and findings reported mean clinical attachment loss increased linearly with age and recession contributed increasingly to CAL with age specially after 45-49years.Therefore reduced periodontium in later stages it may lead to TFO, as compared to early stages of life",NO,Trauma From Occlusion,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Recording of Periodontal Parameters.,"Clinical Attachment level (CAL) ), Measured in mm from CEJ, average 1 year|Probing Pocket Depth (PPD), Measured in mm from free Gingival margin., average 1 year|Interproximal Alveolar Bone level(From CEJ), Measured from CEJ, average 1 year|Pattern of bone Loss., Measured from CEJ, average 1 year",,,Postgraduate Institute of Dental Sciences Rohtak,,ALL,ADULT,,208,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,Ashish kumar perio,2025-06,2026-10,2026-12,2025-05-31,,2025-05-31,"Department of Periodontology ,Post Graduate Institute Of Dental Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana, 124001, India",

In patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer, biopsy markers are used to identify the sites of cancer involvement in both the breasts and lymph nodes. These biopsy markers are critical for guiding surgical management many months after the marker is placed. For breast radiologists and breast surgeons, there is a need for simple, consistent visibility of biopsy markers by ultrasound, particularly several months after marker placement. Ultrasound is the imaging method of choice, particularly for lymph nodes in the armpit (axilla). Ultrasound is non-ionizing and is more comfortable for patients compared to mammography. However, ultrasound visibility of these markers is challenging and inconsistent, with ultrasound failing to detect the marker approximately 25% of the time.

NCT06999785,"Assessment of the Impact of Increased Production of Reactive Oxygen Species Produced During Repeated Sessions of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy for Neoplasia, on the Occurrence of DNA Damage",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06999785,OXYBAR,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is a treatment involving the administration of oxygen at pressures higher than atmospheric pressure, with numerous potential indications such as radiation-induced tissue damage, chronic wounds, and more. HBOT significantly increases the amount of dissolved oxygen in tissues, thereby promoting wound healing.

However, this ""hyperoxygenation"" may also exert toxic effects, particularly through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can induce DNA damage and potentially promote mutagenesis, thereby increasing long-term neoplastic risk.

A single HBOT session is associated with a significant increase in ROS production, which may persist for up to 48 hours post-exposure, and is also linked to DNA damage. DNA repair is typically a rapid process, with the activation of protective mechanisms.

The effects of repeated HBOT sessions remain a matter of debate. Reported outcomes range from attenuation of genotoxicity, to exacerbation of DNA damage, or no effect at all (8). In patients with cancer or comorbidities associated with impaired DNA repair capacity, repeated HBOT could be more detrimental, potentially increasing genotoxic effects and cancer risk. This increased oxygen susceptibility in cancer patients has already been observed in normobaric conditions during abdominal surgery, where hyperoxygenation strategies were associated with increased mortality in this subgroup.

A potential pro-carcinogenic effect of HBOT in cancer patients has also been suggested in some case series, though not confirmed by larger studies.

Current literature on HBOT safety remains generally reassuring; however, the possibility of DNA damage and its potential long-term genotoxic consequences cannot be entirely excluded.

1. Does combining OPR with CPAP increase upper airway space volume compared to using CPAP alone?
2. Does OPR improve tongue muscle strength, and is this improvement associated with reduced CPAP pressure requirements?
3. Do patients receiving OPR (alone or combined with CPAP) show greater improvements in OSA severity and clinical symptoms compared to those receiving CPAP alone or no intervention?

However, activity levels remain low during systemic treatment. Nurses are optimally positioned to lead interventions fostering an activity-friendly culture.

Objective: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and potential effects of the nurse-led, interprofessionally developed physical activity concept OncoMoveNurse in an outpatient oncology setting.

Methods: Using a mixed-methods design over 15 months (10/2024-12/2025), the study includes implementation and evaluation phases. Quantitative data (n=50 patients, collected from 06/2025-09/2025) will assess primary (physical activity behavior) and secondary outcomes (self-efficacy, well-being, mood) via validated PROMs. Qualitative insights will be gathered through digital storytelling (n=2 patients, n=2 nurses) and one focus group (n=8 interprofessional team members). Inclusion criteria for patients include age ≥18, cancer diagnosis, at least three treatments in the day clinic, and sufficient German language skills.

Intervention: OncoMoveNurse comprises five adaptable components: modular activity structure, safety framework, communication strategy, a team approach, and person-centered orientation. Supporting materials (e.g., posters, videos, exercise tools) and tailored implementation strategies were co-developed in alignment with core values.

Analysis: Quantitative data will be analyzed using SPSS (paired t-tests, p\<.05); qualitative data via content analysis in MAXQDA. A mixed-methods synthesis will integrate findings.

Ethics \& Data Protection: Patient data collection will commence following ethics approval. All data are anonymized, stored securely, and handled in accordance with Swiss data protection laws.

The BSA consists of 16 items that capture the duration of physical activity in minutes per day across different intensity levels (light, moderate, vigorous), as well as daily sedentary time. Responses are aggregated and converted into minutes per week. The questionnaire demonstrates good internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.82 to 0.89, and test-retest reliability of r = 0.76.

Responses are given on a four-point Likert scale (1 = not at all to 4 = very much). Scale scores are standardized, with higher scores on the functional scales indicating better quality of life.

The internal consistency of the functional scales ranges from Cronbach's alpha = 0.70 to 0.90.

NCT06999525,Use of Virtual Reality Technologies in Management of Anxiety and Discomfort During Endoscopy Procedure,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06999525,CARVENDO,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Digestive endoscopies are performed either for diagnostic purposes (e.g. suspicion of cancer or monitoring of chronic diseases) or for therapeutic purposes (treatment of digestive haemorrhage, removal of polyps, etc.).

Some endoscopies are performed under local anaesthetic, which can cause considerable anxiety in anticipation of the procedure and considerable discomfort during the procedure. Other endoscopies are performed under general anaesthetic for more extensive procedures on outpatients or inpatients. Anxiety prior to anaesthesia is likely to increase the perception of pain, increase the need for anaesthetic products and thus increase the time to complete awakening.

Complementary techniques such as hypnotherapy can be used before the operation, with proven effectiveness. But these techniques require dedicated and specifically trained staff, as well as additional time.

Virtual reality technologies, and in particular virtual reality headsets, allow instant immersion in a relaxing world. Therapeutic virtual reality headsets (TRVH) have been shown to be effective in reducing pre-operative anxiety and pain perception.

Increasing age is associated with increased cancer risk. In North America and Europe, most people who are diagnosed with cancer every year are aged 65 years or older. Hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma, intra hepatic and hilar cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer and hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer allows better survival compared to other treatments. Similarly, pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is the standard of care in patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma and patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma located in the head of the pancreas. This results in an increasing number of elderly patients being evaluated for hepatic and pancreatic surgery. Major hepatectomy and PD are amongst the most invasive and complex procedures in general surgery with high rates of morbidity as well as negative impact on quality of life. Many studies have reported poor post-surgical outcomes in the elderly patients, especially related to co-morbidities that characterizes this population such as, polypharmacy, cognitive decline, depression and malnutrition. The age in elderly cancer patient is not just a number. The management of these patients should not be limited to oncological care, but it should be extended to different clinical domains including physical, cognitive, psychological, socioeconomic and environmental aspects. In this population, the risk of adverse postoperative outcomes is not adequately described by routine format of current preoperative evaluation, such as age, comorbidities and other traditional tests. Furthermore, the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is scarcely considered. The aim of CGA is to identify current health problems and to guide interventions thus reducing adverse outcomes and optimizing the functional status of older adults. Several trials have indeed shown that CGA and perioperative tailored interventions reduce morbidity and improve patient survival in other surgical disciplines. Similar data is lacking in both hepatic and pancreatic surgery.

The purpose of the study is to learn whether applying exosomes to the scalp, along with microneedling and a precision cooling device called TargetCool™. This study aims to determine whether this combination approach offers synergistic benefits for individuals with hair thinning.

Exosomes are tiny particles that come from stem cells and contain growth factors and other nutrients. They are being studied for their potential to help regenerate skin and hair. TargetCool™ is an FDA-cleared device that uses precision cooling to reduce inflammation and improve comfort. Microneedling is a common, minimally invasive procedure that uses small needles to stimulate the skin and help absorb topical products more effectively.

The study will include healthy men (ages 18 to 70) and women (ages approximately 45 to 70) who are not of childbearing potential. A total of 9 to 15 participants will be randomly placed into one of three groups:

Group 1: Exosomes with TargetCool™ Group 2: Microneedling followed by exosomes and TargetCool™ Group 3: Microneedling followed by exosomes only Participants will receive four treatments over 9 weeks. Each visit may include microneedling, TargetCool™ treatment, and exosome application depending on group assignment.

NCT06999317,CARAMEL: Retrospective Study for Personalized Risk Assessment of Cardiovascular Disease in Menopausal and Perimenopausal Women Using Real World Data,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06999317,CARAMEL RS,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"This retrospective observational study, part of the EU-funded CARAMEL project, aims to develop and validate personalized cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment models specifically designed for menopausal and perimenopausal women (ages 40-60). The study leverages Real World Data (RWD) collected from multiple international clinical partners, including electronic health records (EHR), diagnostic imaging data, and signal data.

The main objective is to improve the prediction of CVD precursors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, as well as mid- and long-term risk of CVD events, through advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. These models will be trained on multimodal data to capture complex, individualized risk trajectories that current risk calculators fail to address, particularly in women. Special focus is placed on under-researched, women-specific risk factors and their interactions with traditional predictors.

The study includes several research objectives: (1) predicting the onset of hypertension and dyslipidemia using EHR data; (2) modeling the long-term risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events and disease trajectories; (3) identifying novel imaging biomarkers from routine screening tests such as mammography, DXA, ultrasound, and cardiac MRI; (4) developing multimodal prediction models combining imaging and clinical data; (5) creating automated AI tools for imaging biomarker extraction; and (6) using signal data from cardiac devices to predict disease progression and events.

The study population consists of middle-aged women with retrospective data available across different health systems. The expected outcome is a validated set of stratified, personalized CVD risk models that can support targeted prevention strategies and enable more equitable, sex-specific care. This will contribute to reducing the burden of CVD in women and addressing critical gaps in early detection, clinical decision-making, and health policy.

NCT06999096,Long-read Genome Sequencing for the Molecular Diagnosis of Dystonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06999096,GenoDYT,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Dystonia is a motor disorder caused by involuntary, intermittent, or sustained muscle contractions, leading to abnormal movements or postures. It can affect any body region and often results in significant functional disability and healthcare burden. Although its familial nature was recognized early on, the advent of high-throughput DNA sequencing has dramatically increased the identification of dystonia-associated genes. Dystonia now encompasses all modes of inheritance-autosomal dominant (e.g., TOR1A, KMT2B), autosomal recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial-and over 100 genes have been implicated. Many forms involve structural variants (SVs) or copy number variations (CNVs), which are challenging to detect using standard short-read sequencing (srWGS).

Molecular diagnosis is essential, ending the diagnostic odyssey and enabling genetic counseling, prognosis, reproductive planning, and-in some cases-targeted therapies. For instance, GNAO1-related dystonia may respond to deep brain stimulation, while dopa-responsive dystonia benefits from levodopa.

Despite advances, srWGS has key limitations, especially for detecting repeat expansions, SVs, and phasing alleles. This likely explains the low diagnostic yield in dystonia compared to other neurological disorders, with over 70% of cases remaining unsolved.

Long-read sequencing (lrWGS), such as Oxford Nanopore technology, overcomes many of these challenges by reading native DNA fragments thousands of bases long. It enables comprehensive detection of SNVs, indels, SVs, CNVs, methylation changes, and repeat expansions-including known and newly discovered pathogenic expansions (e.g., in NOTCH2NLC). It also allows phasing without parental samples, which is crucial in recessive cases.

The incidence ranges between 20 to 80%. Heat loss, reduced sympathetic tone and pyrogen release are termed as the main causes of intra/postoperative shivering.

The redistribution of heat from the core to the periphery of the body is facilitated by the vasodilatation associated with neuraxial anesthesia. Shivering causes tachycardia, lactic acidosis, hyperalgesia at the site of surgery, releases catecholamines, increases oxygen demand, and increases the risk of hypoxemia. \[1\]\[3\] The most common causes of shivering include fever, shivering with spinal anesthesia movement disorders, post-anesthetic shivering, fear, excitement, stress, tremors, low blood sugar, anxiety, and shivering. Shivering with spinal anesthesia is an involuntary, oscillatory muscular activity that significantly increases metabolic heat production, potentially reaching up to 600% above the basal metabolic level.

Post-spinal shivering is one of the main sources of discomfort for patients recovering from surgery. Furthermore, it worsens wound pain and impedes electrocardiographic monitoring.

NCT06999044,Study on the Optimization of the Diagnostic Process for Chronic Rhinitis Using Nasal Allergen Provocation Test,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06999044,,RECRUITING,"Chronic rhinitis (CR) is one of the most prevalent global diseases, with studies estimating that up to 30% of the worldwide population is affected. In China, the prevalence of chronic rhinitis ranges from 10% to 40%, impacting over 300 million individuals. Although non-fatal, CR significantly disrupts daily work and academic performance, predisposes patients to respiratory comorbidities such as nasal polyps and asthma, and may induce systemic complications (e.g., secretory otitis media). Additionally, it detrimentally affects mental health, contributing to psychological disorders, substantial healthcare expenditures, and socioeconomic burdens.

Clinically, CR is broadly classified into allergic rhinitis (AR) and non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) based on skin prick test (SPT) and/or serum-specific IgE results. However, real-world clinical complexity arises as a subset of patients exhibit AR symptoms despite negative test results (local allergic rhinitis), while others with confirmed AR evade detection via conventional methods. This challenges the traditional dichotomous classification, highlighting its growing inadequacy. Given divergent therapeutic strategies for CR subtypes, ambiguous classification frequently leads to ineffective clinical outcomes, necessitating a gold-standard diagnostic framework for precise phenotyping.

The nasal allergen provocation test (NAPT), internationally recognized as the diagnostic gold standard for AR and local allergic rhinitis, directly applies allergens to nasal mucosa to elicit or exacerbate symptoms.

NCT06998927,Proportional Assist Ventilation Plus and Estimation of Respiratory Effort During the Transition to Spontaneous Ventilation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06998927,PAV+ and WOB,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"In intensive care units, many critically ill patients need help from a machine called a ventilator to breathe. Once these patients start to recover, doctors try to gradually reduce this support and help them breathe on their own again. However, not all patients are ready to be taken off the ventilator right away. During this transition, it's important to find the right amount of help-enough to support their breathing, but not so much that the machine does all the work for them.

This study focuses on a special type of ventilator setting called Proportional Assist Ventilation Plus (PAV+). Unlike traditional modes, which give a fixed level of support, PAV+ adjusts the amount of help it gives based on how hard the patient is trying to breathe. The more effort a patient makes, the more support the machine provides-and vice versa. This can make breathing feel more natural and may protect the lungs and breathing muscles during recovery.

Modern ventilators also display a measurement called ""Work of Breathing,"" which tells how much effort the patient is using to breathe. This study wants to find out whether this measurement from the ventilator is a reliable way to monitor a patient's breathing effort, compared to other more invasive or complex methods.

The research will include 20 adult patients who are recovering in the ICU and have been on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. All patients will have already met some criteria showing they're ready to begin breathing more on their own, but are not quite ready to have the breathing tube removed.

Each patient will go through different levels of PAV+ support, and researchers will record how much effort they make to breathe using several methods, including special pressure sensors and data from the ventilator.

The goal of the study is to better understand how to measure breathing effort safely and easily, and to improve how we support patients as they recover the ability to breathe on their own. If successful, this could help reduce complications and improve recovery for people on ventilators.

The major advantage of probiotic administration is its ability to maintain gut microbial homeostasis, reduce pathogenic microorganisms in the GI tract, and restores homeostasis of intestinal microorganisms. Moreover, by modulating microbiota and immune responses, decreasing bacterial translocation, promoting the function of the gut barrier, inducing anti- inflammatory properties, triggering anti-pathogenic activity, and decreasing tumor development and metastasis, probiotics might contribute to the prevention and treatment of GI cancers and lung cancer. Considering the potential roles of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in the initiation of colorectal and gastric cancers, the possible properties of probiotics against GI neoplasm in humans have been investigated in relation to their suppressive effects on H. pylori. The gut microbiota also has proved to in the response and resistance to immunotherapy.

NCT06998784,Effect of Transcutaneous Auricular Vagal Nerve Stimulation on Acute Pancreatitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06998784,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Acute pancreatitis (AP), characterized by the sudden onset of pancreatic inflammation, is a frequent gastrointestinal emergency. Early suppression of the inflammatory response is critical to mitigate disease progression. When localized pancreatic inflammation progresses to systemic inflammation, triggering systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), the condition advances to moderate or severe AP, with mortality rates ranging from 10% to 40%. Additionally, early resumption of enteral nutrition reduces the risk of intra-abdominal infections and organ failure associated with AP. However, gastrointestinal dysfunction, which frequently manifests as gastroparesis or intestinal obstruction in severe cases , significantly complicates AP management by prolonging recovery time and compromising nutritional tolerance. Current early-phase management of AP remains suboptimal: anti-inflammatory strategies are predominantly limited to fluid resuscitation, while gastrointestinal function preservation is frequently underestimated. Consequently, effective therapies targeting both inflammatory suppression and gastrointestinal functional restoration in the early phase of AP are urgently needed.

The central nervous system plays a pivotal role in regulating peripheral immune responses, with the vagal anti-inflammatory signaling pathway serving as a key efferent pathway of the inflammatory reflex. Animal studies have shown a protective effect of the vagal anti-inflammatory signaling pathway against AP. Specifically, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) significantly reduced pancreatic injury and improved survival in mice with severe AP. Furthermore, VNS has shown therapeutic potential in animal models of sepsis, shock, and renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, conditions frequently associated with systemic inflammation in severe pancreatitis. These findings suggest that VNS may alleviate both local and systemic inflammatory responses, as well as their complications.

Notably, prior clinical trial revealed that transcutaneous auricular VNS (taVNS) alleviated functional dyspepsia symptoms in adults, indicating its dual capacity for anti-inflammatory effects and gastrointestinal functional modulation.

NCT06998589,Comparison of the Efficacy and Safety of Delicate Pulsed Light and Q-Switched 1064 nm Nd:YAG Laser in the Treatment of Post-Acne Erythema,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06998589,,COMPLETED,"Acne vulgaris is a common chronic dermatological condition, affecting approximately 85% of adolescents worldwide and ranking eighth among all chronic diseases. Its exacerbation is often associated with recurrent lesions, inadequate treatment, and poor skincare habits such as squeezing or scratching, which frequently lead to the development of post-acne erythema (PAE). PAE is a vascular lesion located beneath the surface of the skin, characterized by a red appearance due to the clustering of dilated capillaries. Although PAE typically improves within 2 to 6 months, it may persist longer in some cases and even result in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. This is particularly prevalent in individuals with darker skin tones, where the incidence of PAE and hyperpigmentation ranges from approximately 45.5% to 87.2%. Facial acne not only affects physical appearance but also significantly impairs social interactions and can lead to psychological distress, including low self-esteem and depression.

Low-energy, large-spot 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser, which belongs to the near-infrared spectrum, has deeper skin penetration and can effectively target deeper dermal tissues. In the treatment of PAE, the laser energy is absorbed by dilated microvasculature in the skin, promoting vasoconstriction and reducing localized redness and swelling. The low energy setting minimizes thermal damage while stimulating collagen production, thereby enhancing skin repair and improving the appearance of erythema.

Delicate Pulsed Light (DPL) operates by emitting pulses of light at specific wavelengths that selectively target skin chromophores. In treating PAE, DPL precisely controls the wavelength and pulse intensity to target dilated blood vessels, thereby alleviating redness and inflammation. Additionally, DPL stimulates the skin's natural repair mechanisms and promotes collagen synthesis, accelerating the resolution of erythema and enhancing overall skin texture. Compared with conventional Intense Pulsed Light (IPL), DPL offers more accurate light modulation, fewer side effects, and better adaptability to various skin types and conditions.

In this study, we conducted a split-face randomized controlled trial to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of low-energy large-spot 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser and DPL in treating acne and PAE. We aimed to explore whether there are significant differences between these two modalities in terms of clinical outcomes for post-acne erythema.",NO,Post-acne Erythema,OTHER: DPL,"PAE lesion count, The post-acne erythema (PAE) lesion count is an important objective indicator for assessing the severity of PAE. It involves recording the number of erythematous lesions on the face to evaluate changes before and after treatment. A higher lesion count indicates more severe erythema and poorer skin recovery. The assessment is typically conducted independently by two trained dermatologists under standardized lighting conditions, with high-resolution imaging systems used when necessary to enhance accuracy and consistency. Care is taken to distinguish PAE from other cutaneous manifestations such as active acne, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and scarring. As a quantitative measure of erythema severity and improvement, the lesion count is widely applied in clinical studies involving light-based and laser therapies., 0, 4, 8, 12 weeks","CEA score, The CEA score can be used to estimate the overall severity of the patient's condition.

The aim of this investigation is to investigate the effect of lower extremity rotational profile on postural control, muscle strength, functional capacity and lower extremity function in children with generalized joint hypermobility. Within the scope of this cross-sectional study, permission was obtained from Bezmialem Vakif University Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Committee with the decision number 177310 dated 31.12.2024. Following the Ethics Committee approval, data collection started and the study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. ""Informed Voluntary Consent Form"" prepared for both parents and children and approved by Bezmialem Vakıf University Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Committee will be signed.

All children participating in the study and their parents will be informed about the study and those who voluntarily agree to participate in the study will be invited by appointment.

All evaluations will be carried out in the Pediatric and Cardiac Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Education and Research Laboratories of the Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation, Faculty of Health Sciences, Bezmialem Vakıf University.

Measurements will be performed using a universal goniometer. The children will be positioned in the prone position with their knees flexed 90° and placed on the edge of the bed. The tuberositas tibia will be chosen as the pivot point of the goniometer, and the movable arm will be aligned with the tibial crista. The fixed arm will be placed perpendicular to the floor and the movable arm will be guided by the tibial crista. During hip rotation, it will be ensured that the hip remains stable and the movement occurs only in the hip joint., Day 1|Rotational Profile- Craig's Test Measurement, The Craig's (Ryder) test, also known as the 'Trochanteric Prominence Angle Test', will be performed on the children included in the study according to the following protocol. The children will be placed in a prone position. The physiotherapist stood on the opposite side of the hip to be tested. The hips of the children will be placed in the extension position and the knee on the side to be tested will be held in the 90° flexion position. The physiotherapist palpated the trochanter major with the left hand and internal rotated the hip with the right hand. At the point where the trochanteric process will be most prominent, the angle between the tibia and the vertical plane will be measured using a goniometer and the femoral anteversion angle will be recorded., Day 1|Rotational Profile- Foot/Thigh Angle Measurement, Foot/thigh angle, assessment will be performed by measuring the angle between the long axis of the femur bone and the foot with a goniometer in the prone position. One arm of the goniometer will be placed parallel to the long axis of the femur, while the other arm will be placed so that it passes through the 2nd and 3rd metatarsals. Normally, the thigh-foot angle should be in external rotation between 10-15°. In young children, this angle can be considered normal up to 30°. A decrease in the thigh-foot angle will indicate internal tibial torsion (expressed as a negative value), which is the internal rotation of the tibia. In this case, there is an abnormal internal rotation of the tibia. If the measured foot-thigh angle exceeds 30°, it is considered to be external tibial torsion (external rotation of the tibia)., Day 1|Rotational Profile- Heel Bisector Line Measurement, The heel bisector line test is an evaluation method that helps diagnose metatarsus adductus. During the test, the child will be placed in the prone position with the heel between the physiotherapist's fingers. Then, the midpoint of the lines drawn from the malleoli will be determined. From this point, a perpendicular line will be drawn from the heel to the toes along the foot axis with the help of a goniometer. Normally, this line should end between the 1st and 2nd toes. If the line ends at the 3rd, 4th or 5th toes, this may indicate the presence of metatarsus adductus., Day 1|Rotational Profile- Q Angle Measurement, Q-angle is defined as the angle formed between an imaginary line connecting the anterior superior iliac spine (SIAS) of the pelvis to the midpoint of the patella and the proximal projection of the line extending from the tibial tubercle to the center of the patella. The child will first be placed in a supine position, with legs extended and muscles relaxed, and the midpoint of the patella will be marked with a colored pencil. Then, the goniometer will be placed at the exact midpoint of the patella, and care is taken to fix the mobile arm so that it points to the SIAS and the fixed arm so that it follows the tibia, and the angle in between will be recorded. The measurement will be recorded in two different positions: lying down and standing. The Q angle is considered normal between 10-15 ° in boys and 15- 20 ° in girls., Day 1|Rotational Profile- Navicular Drop Test Measurement, The navicular drop test is commonly used in clinics to assess pes planus. It will begin with the child sitting, feet flat on the floor, and no weight bearing. The navicular tubercle will be palpated and marked first, then the distance from the tubercle to the floor will be measured. The child will then stand with equal weight on both feet and the distance will be measured again. Measurements will be taken bilaterally and recorded in millimeters. The difference between the weighted and unweighted measurements will indicate foot posture: 5-9 mm is normal (neutral), 10 mm or more will indicate pronation (inward rotation), and 4 mm or less will indicate supination (outward rotation). This test is important for assessing the degree of pes planus., Day 1|Rotational Profile- Foot Progression Angle, The angle of foot progression is an important parameter to identify possible gait disorders and alignment problems by reflecting the rotational relationship between the femur, tibia and foot. For the test, two chairs facing each other will be placed 2 meters apart. The child will sit on a chair and the middle of the heel and the second toe will be marked with colored paint. The child will then stand up and walk naturally on a flat surface for about 5-6 steps towards the opposite chair and leave footprints. The child will then sit on the opposite chair and clean the paint from his feet. The footprints will be measured with a goniometer: one arm will be aligned with the direction of the footprints, the other will be parallel to the axis of the tibia. The angle between the foot and the tibia will be recorded in degrees., Day 1|Postural Control Assessment with the Biodex Balance System (BBS), Postural stability, limits of stability, and sensory integration of balance will be assessed using the Biodex Balance System®. It consists of a balance platform, arm supports, a screen, and a printer. The platform can be set to static or dynamic mode (12 levels; level 12 = most stable, level 1 = least stable with up to 20° movement in all directions). Prior to testing, children will be informed about the procedures. The heel and toe positions will be recorded based on medial-lateral (B-J), anterior, and posterior (1-21) axes. Arm support and screen height will be individually adjusted. Child-specific posture and identification data will be entered into the system. Three tests will be performed: postural stability, limits of stability, and sensory integration of balance., Day 1|Muscle Strength Assessment with Micro-FET 2, Muscle tests will be performed using the MicroFET 2 digital hand dynamometer according to the device manual. The measurement will be performed in supine, prone, side-lying and sitting positions by preventing compensatory movements. During the test, the arms will be positioned so that they will not receive power from anywhere on/to the side of the body. Measurements will be performed bilaterally. While the child to whom the test is applied is expected to perform the requested movement with all his/her strength, the evaluating physiotherapist will apply resistance in the opposite direction in proportion to the strength. During the evaluation of the same muscle, a 30-second break will be given between repetitions, and a five-minute rest will be given before moving on to the test for a different muscle. Isometric muscle strength of the M. Iliopsoas, M. Gluteus Maximus, M. Gluteus Medius, M. Quadriceps, M. Hamstring, M. Tibialis Anterior, M. Gastrosoleus muscles will be evaluated., Day 1|Functional Capacity Assessment with 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT), A 6MWT will be done on a flat 30-meter track marked every 3 meters, with clear start and finish lines. Before the test, the child rests 15 minutes while contraindications will be checked. If none, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, pulse, and Borg scale scores for dyspnea and fatigue will be recorded. Medications taken will be noted. The child will be instructed to walk at their own pace for 6 minutes, allowed to stop or rest, and continue until ""test is over"" is announced. The test will start with ""test is started"" and end with ""test is over."" The timer runs continuously even if paused. The test ends if chest pain, severe breathlessness, cramps, unsteadiness, sweating, pallor, or oxygen saturation \<85% occurs. Afterward, the child sits and post-test vitals and Borg scores will be recorded. Distance walked and any complaints during the test will be noted., Day 1|Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), The Lower Extremity Functional Scale is a questionnaire that will evaluate the functional ability of the entire lower extremity in individuals with musculoskeletal disorders. This scale will question the difficulty experienced in various daily activities due to the problem in the lower extremity with 20 items. Each item is scored between 0-4 on a Likert scale (0=extremely difficult/too difficult to do the activity; 4=not difficult at all). The total score varies between 0-80 and the higher the score, the higher the functional level. A validity and reliability study has been conducted for the Turkish version of the scale to be used in evaluating lower extremity functions., Day 1","Muscle Shortness/Flexibility- Thomas Test Measurement, The Thomas Test will be performed to evaluate shortness/tightness in the hip flexor muscle group, especially in the iliopsoas muscle. The child will be placed in the supine position, the lumbar spine will be fixed and the assessment will begin. During the test, while the assessed hip is in knee extension, the opposite hip and knee will be passively flexed by the physiotherapist, and the hip movement of the assessed side will be observed during this time. The Thomas test will be recorded as negative if no flexion movement is observed in the assessed hip. In the presence of shortness/tightness, the assessed hip is seen to be flexed, and in this case, the Thomas test will be recorded as positive., Day 1|Muscle Shortness/Flexibility- Popliteal Angle Measurement, The popliteal angle test will be used to evaluate shortness or tightness of the hamstring muscles. The hip and knee will be placed in a 90° flexion position while the child is in the supine position. While the physiotherapist passively moves the knee joint towards extension, the popliteal angle will be measured using a goniometer. While one arm of the goniometer is placed parallel to the lateral surface of the femur, the other arm is held parallel to the fibula head and the angle will be measured. The knee joint will be extended until it encounters resistance and the angle between the tibia and the vertical plane will be recorded as the popliteal angle., Day 1|Muscle Shortness/Flexibility- Silfverskiöld Test Measurement, Gastrocnemius assessment will be evaluated with the Silfverskiold test for all children participating in the study. The assessment will be performed bilaterally in supine positions where the child does not bear weight on their feet. The knee joint will be in full extension and 90° flexion, the subtalar joint will be in a neutral position, and the ankle dorsiflexion will be measured with the fixed arm of the universal goniometer on the fibula shaft and the mobile arm following the fifth metatarsal shaft. The measured angles will be recorded in degrees (°). Passive ankle dorsiflexion of ≤ 10° with the knee extended and a minimum of 10° increase in dorsiflexion with the knee flexed will be considered as isolated gastrocnemius muscle shortness., Day 1|Muscle Shortness/Flexibility- Ober Test Measurement, The Ober test will be an assessment to measure the length of the iliotibial band (ITB). During the test, the child will be placed in a supine position with the lower leg slightly flexed at the hip and knee. The upper leg will be in 90° flexion at the knee. Once positioning is complete, the physiotherapist will hold the ankle of the upper leg with one hand and stabilize the hip with the other hand. The leg will then be abducted and the knee extended and the leg moved until the femur is in line with the body. Finally, the thigh will be allowed to fall towards the surface in this plane and the result of the test will be judged by the amount of adduction of the hip. If the knee hangs in the air, the test will be recorded as positive; if the knee falls, the test will be recorded as negative., Day 1|Muscle Shortness/Flexibility- Duncal-Ely Test Measurement, The Duncan-Ely test will be used to evaluate the shortness and tightness of the rectus femoris muscle. While the child will be lying in the prone position, the hip will be fixed with one hand by the physiotherapist and the hip and knee will be kept in extension. In this position, the knee joint will be passively flexed to stretch the rectus femoris muscle on the tested side. If no shortness or tightness is observed in the rectus femoris muscle on the same side during the test and hip extension is maintained, the Duncan-Ely test will be recorded as negative. However, when the knee is flexed and a flexion movement is observed in the hip, the test will be recorded as positive., Day 1|Muscle Shortness/Flexibility- Sit-Reach Test Measurement, The sit-Reach test will be a frequently used test to evaluate the flexibility of the hamstring and lower back muscle groups. The S\&R Sit and Reach® table will be used for this test. The child will sit in front of the table with dimensions of 55 cm long, 35 cm wide, and 30 cm high, and his/her feet will be positioned on the foot surface of the table. The child will be asked to place his/her hands on top of each other and stretch forward in a slow and controlled manner, bringing the ruler on the table forward. He/she will be asked to wait 1-2 seconds at the farthest point without stretching forward or backward. Scoring will be done according to the ruler on the table. (On this table, the child's ability to bring the ruler to the tips of his/her toes corresponds to 23 cm). The test will be repeated three times for each child to ensure reliability, and the highest value will be recorded in cm., Day 1|Pain Assessment with Visual Analog Scale (VAS), The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a simple and reliable tool that is widely used to assess subjective experiences such as pain. It will consist of a 10 cm horizontal line with one end indicating ""no pain"" and the other end indicating ""worst pain imaginable"". Individuals will mark the point that reflects their perception of intensity, which will then be measured in millimeters or centimeters to obtain a numerical score. Higher values will indicate greater intensity. The VAS is valid and reliable in a variety of populations and conditions, including musculoskeletal pain., Day 1","Demographic Information Form, Demographic data, will be all children's gender, age, body weight, height and dominant side information, will be recorded before clinical evaluations. The BMI (kg/m2) of the child will be calculated and recorded with the recorded body weight (kg) and height (m) values., Day 1|Leg Length Measurement, Leg Length Measurement, the child will be placed in a supine position. The legs will be positioned in extension and the muscles will be relaxed. The physiotherapist will measure and record the child's right leg length from the SIAS bone to the medial malleola with a flexible metal tape measure. Measurements will be made bilaterally., Day 1|Ankle Joint Dorsiflexion Range of Motion Measurement, With the knee joint in full extension and 90° flexion, the subtalar joint in a neutral position, the ankle dorsiflexion will be measured with the fixed arm of the universal goniometer on the fibula shaft and the mobile arm following the fifth metatarsal shaft.

NCT06998537,Hemodynamic Effects of Alpha Blockers in Patients With Spinal Anesthesia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06998537,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"There is frequent use of alpha blockers in elderly patients with urological disorders. Various side effects are encountered due to the use of alpha blockers in the elderly age group. Especially hypotension is one of the common side effects. In addition, urological surgery is frequently performed in this age group. Spinal anesthesia is the most preferred anesthesia method in urological surgery. Spinal anesthesia may cause significant vasodilatation and thus hemodynamic changes such as hypotension by causing sympathetic nerve blockade. It is predicted that spinal anesthesia may increase these effects especially in individuals using α-1 adrenergic blockers. In the literature, serious hypotension has been encountered in individuals using alpha blockers under general anesthesia.

NCT06998472,Evaluation of Pediatric Massage in the Treatment of Allergic Rhinitis in Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06998472,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of pediatric tuina (traditional Chinese pediatric massage therapy) in children with allergic rhinitis, aiming to provide an effective, non-invasive treatment option. This study will last for 12 weeks. If you meet the eligibility criteria, agree to participate, and sign the informed consent form, you will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the treatment group or the control group. Random assignment is similar to a dice roll, giving you a 50% chance of being placed in either group.

Participants in the treatment group will receive pediatric tuina in combination with standard Western medical treatment. Participants in the control group will receive only the standard Western medical treatment. At the beginning of the trial, a pediatrician will collect your medical history and basic information. In addition, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioner will conduct a meridian energy assessment and perform a TCM diagnostic evaluation (including the Four Diagnostic Methods and Heat Syndrome Assessment), which will take approximately 20 minutes. A research assistant will help administer a 22-item nasal symptom questionnaire and an allergic rhinitis quality of life questionnaire, which will take about 10 minutes. During the 12-week treatment period, follow-up assessments will be conducted twice-once at week 4 and again at the end of the treatment period in week 12. Both follow-ups will include the meridian energy test, TCM diagnostic evaluation, and allergic rhinitis questionnaires. Throughout the 12-week trial, participants in the treatment group will receive pediatric tuina therapy once a week. Each session will last approximately 15 minutes and will be conducted by a licensed TCM practitioner on a treatment table in the clinic.

The pediatric tuina treatment in this study will primarily focus on regulating the Bladder Meridian (dorsal fascia), Stomach Meridian (abdominal fascia), and the Lower Jiao (pelvic region). The techniques used are based on the Formless Qi Manipulation Tuina method developed by Master Chen Ming-Tang.

The treatment sequence begins with the ""Swimming Belt to Search for Food"" technique, which is used to relax the upper and middle segments of the spine, release tension in the paraspinal muscles, and correct spinal distortions. This is followed by the ""Scooping Water to Splash the Face"" technique to loosen the lower spine and pelvic region, helping to restore balance and alignment in the pelvis. Finally, the ""Master Pulling the Spinning Top"" technique is used to regulate the tibia, thereby improving gait and correcting imbalances in the pelvis and spine caused by improper walking posture.

The goal of this tuina treatment is to restore the body's structural balance. By adjusting muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia back to their proper alignment, qi and blood can circulate smoothly throughout the body. This supports the TCM principle that ""when vital qi is strong, pathogenic factors cannot invade,"" thereby promoting a healthy internal environment.

The Meridian Energy Analysis Device (MEAD) is a computerized, non-invasive diagnostic tool commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. It measures the activity level of the body's meridians and helps provide more accurate diagnostic insight from a TCM perspective. During the test, the practitioner will ask you to hold a testing probe while another probe touches 24 specific acupuncture points around the wrists and ankles.

CCCA is a condition that leads to permanent hair loss, usually starting at the top of the scalp and spreading outward. It can also cause discomfort, such as itching, burning, and pain.

The goal is to see if PRP, which comes from the patient's own blood and is thought to reduce inflammation and promote healing, can stop hair loss and even encourage hair regrowth. PRP has been used to treat other types of hair loss, but it has not been widely studied for CCCA.

Participants in the study will be women of African descent who have been diagnosed with mild to moderate CCCA. Some participants will receive PRP injections, while others will receive a placebo (an inactive treatment) as part of a randomized, double-blind trial.

NCT06998394,"A Single-Arm, Phase II Clinical Trail of Cadonilimab Combined With Chemoradiotherapy in Oligometastatic Stage IVB Cervical Cancer",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06998394,,RECRUITING,"Cervical cancer is one of the most malignant reproductive system tumors that threaten women's health, characterized by distinct HPV-driven carcinogenesis and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. According to statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the GLOBOCAN database, there were approximately 604,127 new cases of cervical cancer worldwide in 2022, with about 341,831 deaths, accounting for 6.5% of all female cancer-related deaths. While HPV vaccines can effectively reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, which has demonstrated 90% efficacy in preventing HPV16/18-associated malignancies, the global incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer have not shown a significant downward trend. Cervical cancer also has a high recurrence rate, with approximately 30% of intermediate and advanced cervical cancer cases recurring within 5 years, and the 5-year survival rate for high-risk patients after recurrence is less than 20%. It is evident that cervical cancer remains a serious threat to women's health. Current research has confirmed that more than 90% of cervical cancer cases are associated with persistent infection with high-risk HPV viruses. HPV-positive status is positively correlated with increased PD-L1 expression, and PD-L1 expression in cervical cancer tissues is closely related to the proliferation and activation of CD8+ T cells. Preclinical models demonstrate that dual checkpoint blockade PD-1/CTLA-4 inhibition synergistically enhances CD8+ T cell activation and tumor regression in HPV+ cervical cancer xenografts. Therefore, cervical cancer patients are likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Based on the unmet treatment needs of cervical cancer and its high immune response, immunotherapy for cervical cancer has become a focus of attention in the field of gynecological oncology in recent years. The pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity characteristics of this regimen, provide an effective treatment option to further improve the survival of advanced cervical cancer patients.

Based on the above research background, this study targets stage IVB cervical cancer with oligometastasis. In addition to systemic chemotherapy combined with individualized radiotherapy, cadonilimab, one bispecific antibody for PD-1/CTLA-4, is added to explore the preliminary anti-tumor activity, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity characteristics of this regimen, providing an effective treatment option to further improve the survival of advanced cervical cancer patients.",NO,Cervical Cancer Stage IV,DRUG: AK104 - Chemotherapy,"1-3-year progression-free survival, From enrollment to 3 years after the end of treatment","Objective response rate, at least 12 weeks|Disease control rate, at least 12 weeks|Overall survival, From date of randomization until the date of death，assessed up to 100 months",,Xiangbo Wan,,FEMALE,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,30,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2024-KY-1629-003,2025-03-12,2027-12-31,2027-12-31,2025-05-31,,2025-05-31,"1 Jianshe East Road, Erqi District, Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, Zhengzhou, Henan, China",

This protein is a voltage-gated calcium channel called CaV1.2 and could be involved in the effects of 5G technology on sleep. The calcium channel CaV1.2 can be selectively blocked by the drug nimodipine.

To demonstrate that CaV1.2 is indeed involved in the effects of 5G technology on sleep, the researchers are investigating in this study, with healthy subjects carrying the sought-after genetic variant, whether the administration of nimodipine and thus the blockade of the calcium channel before exposure mitigates or eliminates the effects of EMF on sleep health.",NO,Mediation of 5G Effects on Sleep,DRUG: Nimodipine Capsules|RADIATION: 5G RF-EMF,"Sleep spindle center frequency, In previous research, the investigators detected a positive shift in the sleep spindle center frequency (during NREM sleep phase) after 30-min pre-sleep exposure to a 5G signal at 3600 MHz, 100 MHz bandwidth in heterozygous T/C allele-carriers (rs7304986) compared to sham.

--- Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive, and life-threatening disease that affects the arteries of the lungs and the right side of the heart. Early diagnosis is essential to initiate appropriate treatment and improve patient outcomes. However, worldwide studies show that there is often a significant delay between the onset of symptoms and the final diagnosis. This delay may lead to disease progression and worse survival.

This multicenter observational study aims to understand the time from the first symptoms to the diagnosis of PAH and other rare diseases across several Brazilian reference centers. By analyzing medical records and patient journeys, the investigators intends to identify factors contributing to delayed diagnosis and potential opportunities for earlier detection.

The study includes adult patients diagnosed with PAH or other selected rare diseases within the last five years. The investigators will analyze time to diagnosis, number and type of physicians consulted, tests performed, and possible misdiagnoses.

Over 60% of these individuals will develop debilitating postural instability and gait disturbances (PIGD), including freezing of gait (FOG). With disease progression, axial motor symptoms typically become resistant to dopamine replacement therapies (e.g. levodopa) and a primary source of disability and morbidity. While subthalamic (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) using standard locations and stimulation parameters can be highly effective for the treatment of the cardinalmotorsymptomsof PD, both treatments often fail to control levodopa-resistant motor features of PD such as PIGD. DBS can also impair cognitive function which further exacerbates PIGD, particularly when the task requires attentional resources. Thus, despite considerable improvements in appendicular bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor with conventional DBS, the disease can continue to be dominated by PIGD, leading to increased falls, decreased mobility, and increased rate of hospitalization and morbidity. This is why one of the top NINDS priorities for clinical research in PD is the development of novel therapeutic approaches, such as DBS targeting, to treat levodopa-resistant motor symptoms.

NCT06998225,Tolerance to Baked Goods in Allergic Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06998225,BFT,COMPLETED,"Food allergies are more common in children, especially in Western countries. Around 5 to 8% of children have at least one food allergy, compared to only 1-2% of adults. These allergies can really affect child's quality of life and create stress for the whole family. The most common foods that cause allergic reactions are cow's milk, egg, nuts, fish, and shellfish.

Until now, the usual way to manage a food allergy has been to completely avoid the food. But this can be hard, limiting kids diets and puts them at risk of accidental exposure, and may even cause nutritional problems.

Oral immunotherapy (OIT) has become and alternative treatment. It consists in giving very small amounts of the food allergen regularly to help the body get used to it. Some studies show this helps children build tolerance faster than just avoiding the food. But OIT also comes with risks, including allergic reactions during the treatment, some of which can be serious.

Some research is focusing on a gentler and safer option: giving children baked milk or baked egg. When milk or egg is baked (for example, in muffins or cookies), the high heat changes the proteins, making them less likely to cause allergic reactions. The heat breaks the parts of the protein that the immune system usually reacts to, and mixing them with wheat flour makes them even less reactive.

Interestingly, this doesn't work for every food, peanuts, for example, can actually become more allergenic when heated. But in the case of milk and egg, baking seems to be very helpful.

Giving baked milk or egg to allergic children has shown some immune system changes similar to OIT, but in a safer and more natural way. This can make life a lot easier, not just for the kids, but also for their families since it broadens their diet, improves their nutrition, and reduces stress in social situations.

Studies suggest that introducing baked milk and egg early on could also help kids become fully tolerant sooner.

At Sant Joan de Déu Hospital in Barcelona, doctors have been using OIT for milk and egg allergies since 2006 in children over 5 years old. While the treatment has helped many, not all children become fully desensitized, and some still react to milk or egg occasionally. The success rate is around 70%, and it's often less effective in children with severe allergies, like those who have had anaphylaxis.",NO,Cow Milk Protein Allergy|Hen Egg Allergy,DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Dietary intervention using cookies containing milk or egg low dose.|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Dietary intervention with cow's milk or egg baked cookies high dose,"1.

This technique involves the insertion of a needle through the rectal mucosa to access the prostate. While TRUS-guided biopsy demonstrates a high detection rate for prostate cancer, it also carries a significant risk of post-procedural complications, such as hematuria, rectal bleeding, urinary retention, and anemia.

Compared to other biopsy methods, TRUS-guided biopsy is associated with higher rates of hospital readmissions and an increased risk of infection and sepsis. These complications contribute to elevated healthcare costs, prolonged hospital stays, increased workload for healthcare providers, heightened patient stress and anxiety levels, greater analgesic requirements, the potential for additional complications, and reduced patient satisfaction.

Various non-pharmacological methods have been shown to be effective in preventing these adverse patient outcomes. One such method, which has been identified in the literature as effective, is cold application. Cold application is a widely preferred non-pharmacological intervention due to its simplicity, affordability, and accessibility. It is particularly used to reduce acute pain, edema, and bleeding. Cold therapy slows down metabolism, thereby reducing the oxygen and nutrient demands of tissues; it also limits inflammation, muscle spasm, and edema, alleviates pressure and tension on nerve endings, and decreases the conduction velocity of peripheral nerves. These effects contribute to a reduction in patients' pain, anxiety associated with pain, and bleeding.

NCT06998082,AI-Driven Early Warning System for Perioperative Risks in Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06998082,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Acute hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease is a life-threatening condition characterized by sudden onset, rapid progression, multiple complications, poor prognosis, and high mortality. It presents a significant public health burden. During surgical interventions, precise risk stratification and effective perioperative management are crucial to mitigating intraoperative and postoperative complications, optimizing disease diagnosis, guiding severity assessment, and refining anesthesia strategies. Continuous real-time evaluation and dynamic perioperative adjustments are essential to minimize the influence of institutional variability and individual clinician-dependent decision-making. By harnessing big data-driven, evidence-based medical approaches, clinicians can enhance diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic precision, addressing a critical challenge in reducing morbidity and mortality in this patient population.

This study aims to develop a comprehensive multimodal perioperative database and leverage large language models (LLMs) for the efficient extraction of structured demographic and clinical data throughout the perioperative course. By integrating real-time hemodynamic monitoring parameters, the investigators seek to elucidate the relationship between perioperative hemodynamic patterns and the incidence of postoperative complications affecting major organ systems, including the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs. The ultimate goal is to construct a multimodal fusion early-warning model capable of real-time, simultaneous prediction of multiple perioperative complications. This AI-driven platform will function as a risk stratification and alert system for organ-specific perioperative complications in patients with acute hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease. By providing evidence-based insights for optimized perioperative management-encompassing early warning mechanisms, diagnostic support, and individualized therapeutic strategies-the system aims to improve clinical outcomes, reduce perioperative morbidity, and lower overall mortality.",NO,Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke,,"The primary outcome measures were postoperative complications involving the neurological, cardiac, pulmonary, and renal systems in patients with acute hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease following surgical interventions., Within 30 days after surgery",,,Beijing Tiantan Hospital,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,1533,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,20250401,2025-07-06,2027-12-31,2028-12-31,2025-05-31,,2025-05-31,"Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Beijing, Beijing, 100070, China",

It has now become a major obstacle to social and economic development. Stem cells are a type of primitive cells with self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation potential. Under certain conditions, they can differentiate into cells of various tissues and organs. They have now become one of the key research directions for the repair of functional disorders after ischemic stroke. Compared with other types of stem cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have the advantages of being relatively easy to obtain with less tissue damage, convenient and rapid in vitro expansion and culture, and the ability to actively migrate to the lesion area after injection without the risk of canceration.

Sometimes, it can detach from the wall of the eye, causing a condition called rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD), which leads to vision loss and requires surgery. The most common surgery for RRD is vitrectomy, but this can lead to complications like cataracts, which worsen over time and need to be removed with another surgery. Cataract surgery involves replacing the cloudy lens with a clear artificial one. Currently, it's unclear whether it's better to perform both surgeries at the same time or separately. The COMBAT study aims to find out which approach is best by comparing the outcomes of patients who have vitrectomy alone versus those who have both surgeries (vitrectomy and cataract surgery by phacoemulsification and intraocular lens \[IOL\] implantation) together.

Who can participate? Adults aged 50 and older who have RRD but are not highly myopic (less than -6 diopters or an axial length of 26.5 mm or less) and have not had previous vitreoretinal surgery. Participants must be scheduled for a pars plana vitrectomy to repair their RRD.

What does the study involve? Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one group will have vitrectomy first and, if needed, cataract surgery later; the other group will have both surgeries at the same time.

To stop a nosebleed in the emergency department, doctors usually have to burn the nose (called cauterization) or insert pledgets (called nasal packing) into the nose to apply direct pressure to the bleeding site. Nasal packing can cause pain and discomfort at the time it is inserted in the nose and again when it is removed. In rare cases it can cause a range of complications: minor complications include scar bands in the nose, but serious complications of nasal packing have also occurred, including death. Nasal packing can also present risks to doctors, such as the risk of contracting airborne and bloodborne infections, like COVID-19 and HIV.

Tranexamic acid in pill form or given directly into a vein is a medication that is currently used for nosebleeds.

NCT06997705,Integrated HPV Vaccination and Adolescent Health in Ivory Coast,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06997705,SHARP-CI,RECRUITING,"Background: Cervical cancer is a serious global public health problem, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is the leading cause of cancer in women, with around 70,722 new cases each year. Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) prevents cervical cancer and is usually given to children around 9 to 15 years of age. HPV vaccination has been incorporated into many countries' Expanded Programs on Immunization, but often faces optimization and uptake challenges. SHARP is an implementation research initiative in Tanzania, Nigeria, and Côte d'Ivoire that is looking at the potential of combining HPV vaccination with with adolescent primary care/preventive health services - how this might work and its effect on the uptake of the HPV vaccine and other services.

Objective: To describe the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness and sustainability of a locally-designed integrated adolescent health service package, including HPV vaccination in Cote d'Ivoire. Specifically, this study aims to optimize existing primary health care approaches, making service delivery not only more convenient but also more effective in addressing the specific needs of adolescents-both in school and out of school-across schools, communities, and health facilities.

Methods: This is a quasi-experimental research study using the difference-in-difference method between an intervention group and a comparison group over time. It will use mixed methods drawing on quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews, service time motion assessment, and administrative data. The study will be conducted in two regions, each with an intervention and comparison district. The optimized adolescent integrated health intervention will be implemented in the intervention districts with routine service provision in comparison areas. Monthly administrative service coverage data and baseline and endline surveys will be conducted in up to 3502 households with 1626 parents/caregivers and 1626 adolescents will assess effectiveness by looking at changes in service uptake and coverage, as well in knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards HPV vaccination and integrated services.

Postoperative acute pain and, more importantly, the progression of acute pain into chronic pain, remain significant challenges in the postoperative period. Effective postoperative pain management is therefore crucial in inguinal hernia repair.

In addition to systemic analgesia, various regional anesthesia techniques are employed in this setting. In recent years, peripheral nerve blocks such as the ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric (IL/IH) block, transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block, and quadratus lumborum block (QLB) have gained popularity for postoperative analgesia. These techniques offer several advantages, including reduced opioid consumption and decreased need for additional analgesics, while also minimizing hemodynamic instability and facilitating early mobilization.

The IL/IH block is performed by injecting a local anesthetic into the fascial plane between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles, targeting the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves, which are branches of the L1 spinal nerve. The TAP block, first described by Rafi in 2001, involves injecting local anesthetic into the fascial plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles within the Petit triangle, where the T6-T11 spinal nerve branches responsible for abdominal wall innervation are located. The quadratus lumborum block (QLB) was initially described by Blanco. The first version, known as QLB1, involves posterior injection of local anesthetic lateral to the quadratus lumborum muscle. In 2013, Jens Børglum introduced the transmuscular variant (QLB3), where the local anesthetic is administered between the quadratus lumborum and psoas muscles.

In this study, we aimed to compare postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair under spinal anesthesia, with and without additional peripheral nerve blocks (IL/IH block, TAP block, and QLB). Specifically, we evaluated pain levels using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at the 30th minute, 2nd, 6th, 12th, and 24th hours postoperatively. We also assessed opioid-related side effects such as nausea and vomiting associated with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) using tramadol, the total bolus and infusion doses of tramadol administered, and the amount of additional analgesia in the form of paracetamol. These outcomes were compared among the different block groups and with a control group that received only spinal anesthesia without any additional block.",NO,Inguinal Hernia|Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block|Iliohypogastric/Ilioinguinal Nerve Block|Quadratus Lumborum Block,PROCEDURE: Ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric Nerve Block|PROCEDURE: Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block|PROCEDURE: Quadratus Lumborum Block (QLB),"Postoperative Pain Score, Postoperative pain will be assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (the worst imaginable pain).

NCT06997510,Better4All Personalized Intervention,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06997510,BETTER4ALL,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The BETTER4U (Preventing obesity through Biologically and bEhaviorally Tailored inTERventions for you) project, funded by the European Union, aims to address obesity through biologically and behaviourally tailored interventions. Obesity is a major public health issue influenced by genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle factors. Despite current weight management interventions, many individuals face challenges due to these varied influences. The BETTER4U project seeks to improve weight management by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) to personalize interventions. The goal is to test the effectiveness of these personalized interventions in improving weight loss compared to standard care, using advanced monitoring tools and AI models.

The BETTER4ALL personalized intervention is a multicentre, open-label, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving seven study sites across Cyprus, France, Greece, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden. A total of 1,022 participants with overweight or obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²), aged 18-65 years, will be enrolled. Participants will be randomized into two groups: an intervention group receiving personalized lifestyle recommendations based on AI and PRS, and a control group receiving standard care recommendations. The intervention will last six months, followed by a six-month follow-up assessment.

The intervention's key aspects include wearable devices and a mobile application to monitor participants' behaviour, including physical activity, sleep, and eating habits. The intervention also integrates genetic, metabolic, and environmental data to provide tailored recommendations for weight loss. Participants' outcomes will be assessed regarding BMI, weight loss maintenance, changes in clinical biomarkers, body composition, and other lifestyle parameters.

This RCT will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of personalized weight management strategies. AI-driven personalized recommendations and real-time monitoring represent a significant shift from traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches. The results of this study could offer a more effective and sustainable model for obesity management, particularly by accounting for individual genetic predispositions and lifestyle factors. Furthermore, by evaluating the impact of the intervention on a wide range of health outcomes, including biomarkers and psychosocial factors, the study will provide a comprehensive understanding of how personalized interventions can improve overall health and weight management.

In addition to contributing to the scientific understanding of obesity and its management, this project has the potential to influence public health strategies, offering a more personalized, data-driven approach to obesity prevention and treatment.

NCT06997406,'Inner Ear Support' Oral Capsule in Patients With Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06997406,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is a medical condition where people experience rapid hearing loss, usually in one ear, over a short period of time (typically within 72 hours). It can affect people of any age, though it is more common among adults aged 40 to 60. In many cases, the exact cause remains unknown, but possible reasons include viral infections, immune-related problems, and reduced blood circulation to the inner ear. Along with hearing loss, many patients may also experience tinnitus (ringing in the ears) or dizziness.

The standard treatment for SSNHL often involves steroids, sometimes combined with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. However, the effectiveness of these treatments varies, and many patients do not fully recover their hearing. This study aims to explore whether an additional supplement-'Inner ear support' oral capsule-can improve hearing outcomes and relieve associated symptoms in patients with SSNHL.

The study will involve 80 participants who are randomly assigned to two groups. Both groups will receive standard treatment (including steroids and possibly hyperbaric oxygen therapy), but only the test group will take the 'Inner ear support' capsule twice daily for 28 days. Participants will be followed and evaluated over a period of 196 days through hearing tests and symptom questionnaires.

'Inner ear support' is a commercially available nutritional supplement that includes FB-1603 (an extract from Arthrospira maxima), GABA, gamma-oryzanol, and sesamin. Previous research has shown that FB-1603 and its active component, C-phycocyanin, have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and nerve-protective effects. Animal studies suggest it may help reduce tinnitus and prevent hearing deterioration.

This clinical trial is designed to evaluate whether 'Inner ear support' can enhance hearing recovery, improve tinnitus and dizziness symptoms, and be safely used as an additional treatment in patients with sudden hearing loss. All participants will be monitored for any potential side effects during the study period.

NCT06997354,Validation of a Parental Questionnaire for Screening Children for Neurovisual Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06997354,,RECRUITING,"Some children present visual difficulties linked not to damage to the eye, but to damage to the brain. This type of dysfunction of the visual cerebral pathways leads, for example, to difficulties in recognition, visuomotor coordination or visuo-spatial disorders. These highly specific disorders are known as ""cortical visual impairment"" (CVI). Despite their real impact on children's development, these disorders are still poorly diagnosed in the French-speaking world. As a result, follow-up and care for these children are poorly adapted. A better understanding of neurovisual disorders and the availability of validated tools in French are therefore essential. Indeed, it is currently considered that 3 to 4% of children aged four to six, i.e. around one child per kindergarten class, have a CVI following a neuro-logical lesion acquired in the perinatal period.

Because of the lack of a valid tool in French, the aim of the present study is to provide the results of a validation study of a parental questionnaire for screening children with warning signs of CVI in French. This questionnaire will be offered online using the Qualtrics tool. In order to evaluate the relevance of this questionnaire, it will be proposed, on the one hand, to parents whose child (aged 3 to 12) does not present any particular developmental difficulties, and on the other hand, to parents whose child (aged 3 to 12) seems to present signs of neurovisual disorders.

The alignment of these behavioural patterns with underlying biological rhythms is closely linked to physiological function, with misalignment linked to chronic metabolic diseases.

The vast majority of evidence about rhythms in metabolism comes from studies of rodents, which is remarkable given that rodents differ fundamentally from humans in both behaviour and metabolic regulation. Moreover, almost no research in any species has examined the effects of muscle contractile activity on 24-h rhythms in metabolism. Skeletal muscle is a key site of metabolic regulation and contractile activity is a powerful stimulus to increase metabolism. The researchers have established a novel protocol for serial muscle sampling throughout 24 hours and pilot work completed in preparation for this grant revealed diurnal transcriptomic and lipidomic rhythms in human skeletal muscle. Further development of that protocol has used enteral feeding via a tube which delivers nutrient directly to the stomach to enable constant nutrient delivery (including during sleep), with preliminary data indicating that underlying rhythms in metabolism are responsive to nutrient availability patterns.

The researchers will now capitalise on those findings by incorporating multiple isotope tracers within the protocol, thus finally documenting the nature of rhythmic flux in carbohydrate metabolism and protein turnover in human skeletal muscle, and how those rhythms are aligned with timing and patterns of exercise. In summary, participants will stay in the laboratory for 36 hours with 24 hours of constant feeding via nasogastric tube, and muscle and blood sampling.

The sensitivity of cancer patients to anti-tumor treatments, the occurrence of side effects, and their quality of life are closely related to their nutritional status. Data show that about 50% of cancer patients experience a weight loss of more than 10% at the time of diagnosis and treatment, and once patients enter a cachexia state, the weight loss becomes difficult to reverse. Therefore, the extent to which nutritional interventions can impact clinical outcomes in these patients needs to be answered through clinical research. Currently, there are few studies using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to explore how nutritional interventions can improve patients' quality of life, particularly in terms of prolonging survival. A recent RCT in a smaller sample population found that long-term, intensive, individualized nutritional counseling and support not only improved malnutrition in cancer patients, reduced treatment complications, and enhanced quality of life but also significantly extended survival time.

This study is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial aimed at investigating the effect of full-scale intelligent nutrition management in gastrointestinal malignancy patients (esophageal cancer, gastric cancer) undergoing chemotherapy. The study attempts to confirm that full-scale intelligent nutrition management can benefit these patients by maintaining or improving their nutritional status, and that the clinical effectiveness of intelligent nutrition management is comparable to that of professional nutritionists.

Treatment for insomnia includes non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions, with clinical practice often utilizing sedative medications for sleep, but with side effects such as dependency, tolerance, daytime drowsiness, and withdrawal symptoms, which make it challenging for patients to find suitable medical treatment. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) approaches insomnia by first conducting a thorough assessment based on individualized patterns (differentiation of body constitution) and evaluating insomnia-related symptoms, followed by an examination of tongue and pulse to determine the correct treatment plan, which may involve acupuncture, herbal medicine or a combination of both (integrative treatment).

NCT06997133,Sucralose as a Way to Enhance Regulatory T Cells,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06997133,SWEET,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Title: Taking the SWEET approach to protect the transplanted kidney.

Background: Kidneys are essential organs in our body. When they do not work, patients require machines to help them or receive a new kidney from a donor (transplantation) to survive. Thus far, transplantation is the best treatment. However, the immune system will recognize the new kidney as foreign and try to destroy it, which is called kidney rejection. To prevent rejection, patients with kidney transplants depend on drugs to suppress the immune system. However, these drugs have many side effects, including the risk of infection, cancer, and diabetes.

The immune system is made of many different types of cells. One cell type in particular is T cells that, when kept unchecked, will attack the kidney transplant. However, there is a small subset of these T cells called regulatory T cells (Tregs) that police the immune system and aid in accepting the new kidney. Current ways to increase these police cells (Tregs) after a transplant are expensive and not widely available. Therefore, there is a need to find a better and more accessible way to increase Treg numbers after a transplant to increase the longevity of the newly transplanted kidney.

What we eat is critical in shaping the immune system. Artificial sweeteners, like sucralose (found in Splenda), are often used as a sugar substitute. They are low in calories and safe to consume. However, recent studies suggest they may have unexpected effects on the body. Research in mice has shown that sucralose impacts the immune system. Specifically, the investigators have found that it could suppress T cells that could cause kidney rejection while increasing the Tregs (the police).

Given these findings, the investigators hypothesize that sucralose could be beneficial in conditions where dampening the immune system is desirable, such as in the case of transplantation. By boosting Tregs and reducing the anti-transplant T cells, sucralose may help to protect against organ rejection.

Purpose: The goal of this study is thus to test whether sucralose can safely and effectively modulate the immune system in humans.

Method: The investigator propose to test the impact of sucralose on the immune system. This pilot study will test the effect of sucralose in 10 healthy volunteers. The participants will take sucralose or placebo as a pill twice daily for a month. Healthy volunteers will then stop for a two weeks (washout period). After the washout period, the volunteers on sucralose will switch to placebo, while the placebo group will switch to sucralose pills for one more months. The investigators will take blood samples at the beginning, after one month, after the washout and at the end of the study to study how the immune system changes.

Anticipated outcomes: The investigators expect that sucralose will impact the immune system and increase the number of regulatory T cells.

Relevance to patient/community: Artificial sweeteners are commonly used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. However, their impact on the immune system has not been thoroughly investigated in humans.

Conclusion: Kidney transplantation is the most effective treatment for kidney failure, but the immune system's rejection of the transplanted organ remains a major challenge. Current immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent rejection have significant side effects, underscoring the need for safer alternatives. The investigator research suggests that sucralose, a widely used artificial sweetener, may offer a novel solution by increasing the good T cells (Tregs) and reducing harmful T cells that contribute to rejection. This pilot study will explore sucralose's potential to modulate the immune system in humans, potentially leading to improved transplant outcomes and broader implications for immune regulation.",NO,Healthy Volunteer,DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: sucralose|OTHER: Placebo,"Regulatory T cells, Change in % regulatory T cells on total CD4+ T cells compared to baseline, After 4 weeks on sucralose and placebo.","T cell cytokine production (TNFa, IFNy, IL2), % cytokine production o CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, 4 weeks compared to baseline on either placebo or sucralose|Frequency of immune populations in the blood (CD4+, CD8+, NK, B cells, CD11b myeloid cells), % of CD45+ cells (total immune marker), 4 weeks compared to baseline on either sucralose or placebo|Frequency of CD4+ T cells lineages, % RORyt, T-bet, GATA3 on CD4+ T cells, 4 weeks compared to baseline on sucralose or placebo|Frequency of naive, central and effector memory or terminally differentiated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, % of CD62L+CD45RA+CD45RO- (naive), CD62L+CD45RO+CD44+CD45RA- (central memory), CD62L-CD45RA-CD45RO+CD44+ (effector memory) and CD62L-CD45RA+CD45RO (terminally differentiated cells) on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, 4 weeks c ompared to baseline on both sucralose or placebo",,Caroline Lamarche,Ciusss de L'Est de l'Île de Montréal,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,10,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE",2025-3912,2025-09-01,2026-09-01,2026-12-01,2025-05-30,,2025-05-30,"Centre de recherche de l'Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Quebec, H1T2M4, Canada",

NCT06997042,Creation of Arteriovenous Fistulas for Hemodialysis Using the End-to-side Anastomotic Technique vs. Piggyback. Randomized Clinical Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06997042,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Creation of Arteriovenous Fistulas for Hemodialysis: End-to-Side vs. Piggyback Anastomosis - A Randomized Clinical Trial

1. Background and Rationale

   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects an estimated 15.1% of the Spanish population and is a growing public health concern, especially due to its progression to advanced stages requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). Hemodialysis is the most common RRT, and the quality of vascular access significantly influences outcomes in these patients.

   Among vascular access options, arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are preferred over central venous catheters (CVCs) and arteriovenous grafts (AVGs), due to superior durability, fewer complications, and lower hospitalization rates. However, AVFs suffer from high early failure rates, with maturation failures occurring in up to 60% of cases.

   Traditionally, the end-to-side (ETS) anastomosis is the gold standard for AVF creation. In recent years, an alternative technique called the Piggyback Straight Line Onlay Technique (pSLOT) has shown potential benefits, including improved hemodynamics, reduced stenosis, and lower rates of thrombosis and dysfunction.

   Despite promising retrospective data and small prospective studies, no robust randomized controlled trial has conclusively determined whether pSLOT offers superior outcomes compared to the classical ETS technique.
2. Study Hypothesis

   The null hypothesis is that there will be no significant difference between ETS and pSLOT techniques in terms of:
   * Clinical and ultrasound-based maturation at 1 month
   * Clinical and ultrasound-based maturation, patency, and functionality at 12 months
3. Study Objectives

   Primary Objective

   To compare the rate of clinical and ultrasonographic maturation at 1 month, and the combined rate of maturation, patency, and functionality at 12 months between ETS and pSLOT groups.

   Secondary Objectives

   To compare:
   * Juxta-anastomotic stenosis rate
   * Thrombosis rate
   * Reintervention rate
   * Fistula blood flow
   * Maturation and surgery times
   * Wound-related complications
4. Methods and Study Design

   This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial with two parallel groups:
   * Group A: ETS technique
   * Group B: pSLOT technique

   Randomization occurs intraoperatively (1:1 allocation) using a centralized system. The patient is blinded to the allocation. The surgical team is not blinded due to the nature of the procedure, and follow-up staff are aware of the technique due to its visibility on ultrasound.

   The trial will enroll 130 patients to account for a 15% dropout rate, aiming for 56 evaluable patients per group. This sample size is based on previous data indicating differences in juxta-anastomotic stenosis rates (16.7% vs. 40.3%).
5. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

In France, 54% of new infections were heterosexual in 2022, 71% of whom were born abroad, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa (74%). Among women, 80% of new cases were born abroad, of which at least 30% contracted HIV after arriving in France, often in connection with social vulnerability as shown by the French study Parcours. In the Paris region, 1,243 new cases among women were registered between 2018 and 2021 (about 300 per year).

Unstable housing, experiences of violence, lack of residence permits and sex trade increase the risk of HIV among women. Positive test migrants often report a higher frequency of forced sex. These women also face high risks of other STIs, unwanted pregnancies, violence and mental health problems.

PrEP is a means of preventing HIV infection by taking an antiretroviral drug, which has been fully proven to be effective in the form of tablets or injections. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is part of a comprehensive prevention service pathway.

Despite the free availability of PrEP in France from 2027 and essential monitoring tools for men and women at high risk, women at risk remain largely uncovered by prevention initiatives, making them a ""hidden population"" under-studied. In France, recent data show that only 5% of PrEP users are women, compared to 95% of men, mainly men who have sex with men (MSM).

Several factors hinder access to PrEP, including limited knowledge of available services, misperceptions of risk (because women rarely initiate sexual intercourse), fear of stigma and lack of resources. In addition, France lacks comprehensive programs that integrate health care, sexual health, mental health and social and legal support for these women.

NCT06996808,Intrauterine Balloon (Bakri©) Versus Uterine Tamponade With Chitosan Gauze (Celox PPH©) in the Management of Postpartum Hemorrhage Refractory to Medical Treatmen,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06996808,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) remains one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. It is defined as blood loss of more than 500 mL after vaginal delivery or more than 1000 mL after cesarean section, but severe PPH is typically identified when blood loss exceeds 1000 mL regardless of delivery mode. The initial management of PPH includes the administration of uterotonics such as oxytocin, methylergometrine, and tranexamic acid. However, a subset of patients remains unresponsive to medical therapy, necessitating second-line interventions to avoid escalation to invasive procedures such as uterine artery embolization or peripartum hysterectomy.

An intrauterine balloon tamponade device (Bakri©), is commonly used as a mechanical method to control uterine bleeding by exerting direct pressure on the uterine walls. Its use has been widely adopted and incorporated into international guidelines due to its relative ease of use and safety profile. Despite its effectiveness, the failure rate of Bakri balloon placement can range from 20% to 40%, especially in cases of coagulopathy or diffuse atony.

Gauzes with a chitosan-based hemostatic dressing (Celox PPH ©) , has been extensively used in trauma settings and is increasingly being explored for surgical and obstetric applications. Its mechanism involves promoting clot formation independent of the clotting cascade, making it potentially beneficial in patients with coagulopathies. Preliminary data and case reports suggest that Celox PPH© may be effective in controlling intrauterine bleeding when used as a packing material after vaginal or cesarean delivery, but no high-quality randomized controlled trial has yet compared it directly with standard interventions.

Using a Likert-type scale, determining the severity of symptoms provides important data for treatment and intervention planning.

In particular, being organized in 3 sub-dimensions (somatic, psychological and urogenital complaints) helps understand the different aspects of menopause. This diversity provides a comprehensive assessment for both health professionals and researchers. The Likert-type scale, which includes menopausal complaints, is scored between 0 and 4. It indicates that the complaint is not present at all, while 4 indicates that it is very severe.

Especially the Likert-type assessment consisting of 32 questions and scored from 1 to 8 is very useful in examining the severity of problems in the menopausal process. Such a scale is an important tool for understanding the difficulties experienced by women in the menopausal period and for making appropriate interventions. The scoring of each subdomain helps determine the degree to which problems specific to that subject cause discomfort, which allows for more effective development of treatment and support plans.

This scale evaluates an individual's sleep according to various factors (e.g., sleep duration, time to fall asleep, and difficulty felt upon waking).

This scale, consisting of 24 questions, consists of 19 questions based on the individual's self-assessment and 5 questions answered by the spouse or roommate.

It mandates that adult patients with significant pain (VAS ≥50mm or NRS ≥5) undergo an at-home screening trial, which must show at least 50% pain reduction to proceed with permanent implantation. While screening trials allow patients to experience the therapy beforehand, they are costly, duplicative, and carry risks such as infection. A recent UK study (TRIAL-STIM) found no significant difference in outcomes between patients who had screening trials and those who received an all-in-one SCS procedure, but the trial strategy incurred greater costs. Given these findings, and the fact that all-in-one procedures are already used in certain Dutch cases, it is reasonable to evaluate this approach more broadly.

Its prevalence has increased significantly over the past 30 years, with up to 20% of children affected, often within their first year of life. AD is characterized by erythematous, scaly, pruritic lesions, xerosis, and frequent atopy, with distinct clinical features in children compared to adults.

The pathophysiology of AD involves skin barrier dysfunction, immune response alterations, and environmental triggers. Genetic factors, particularly mutations in the filaggrin gene, play a significant role in severe AD, leading to increased water loss and skin dehydration. Immunologically, a Th2-predominant response drives inflammation, and environmental exposures, such as air pollutants and irritants, exacerbate the condition.

Recent studies suggest that dietary habits, particularly a high intake of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), may contribute to AD by activating inflammatory pathways. UPFs, rich in advanced glycation end products (AGEs), induce oxidative stress and inflammation, potentially worsening skin damage.

All patients who met all the inclusion criteria and non of the exclusion criteria and signed an informed consent form were enrolled and randomized to one of two testing protocols used to guide treatment (PCR guided Arm, and C\&S guided Arm). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio based on their unique sequential randomization numbers assigned at enrollment.

Urine samples were collected from all patients and tested using both PCR and C\&S methods before randomization; however, investigators remained blinded to the comparator test results throughout the trial. To ensure unbiased treatment decisions, clinicians were blinded to the comparator test results. Treatment was prescribed solely based on the assigned test-PCR results for the PCR arm and C\&S results for the C\&S arm. The comparator test results remained blinded until the end of the study (EOS)

Urine specimens were collected using a clean-catch midstream technique at two distinct time points-at baseline visit/before randomization (Day1) and at EOS visit (Day 28)-following targeted therapy based on the assigned diagnostic arm. Collected samples were immediately stored at 2-8 ◦C until analysis to preserve sample integrity. Upon receipt, urine samples were aliquoted for parallel testing, with one portion analyzed using PCR (QuantStudio 7 or 12 and KingFisher) and the other processed using C\&S methodologies.

Molecular testing (Doc Lab UTM 2.0) involved qualitative PCR amplification targeting 28 uropathogen species and 16 classes of antibiotic resistance genes, covering both bacterial and fungal pathogens. All urine samples for urine C\&S were shipped to the central laboratory. The urine culture, isolation of uropathogen(s), initial identification of pathogen(s), and bacterial counts in urine were conducted in the central laboratory. The urine samples were cultured and quantified using a calibrated loop to identify a quantitative count of bacteria at a lower limit of 10\^5 CFU/mL. All purified pathogen(s) were further analyzed for species identification and antimicrobial sensitivity

The primary endpoint was the number (and percentage) of subjects in each study arm with favorable clinical outcomes (FCl) at the EOS visit. The FCl was defined as a patient's clinical response, assessed by the treating investigator, indicating either clinical improvement or cure. Clinical improvement was defined as the resolution of at least one symptom of cUTI present at baseline, absence of new cUTI symptoms, and/or avoidance of parenteral antibiotic therapy following randomization. Clinical cure was defined as the complete resolution of all acute signs and symptoms of cUTI present at baseline, to the extent that no further antimicrobial therapy (either IV or oral) was required for the treatment of the cUTI.

The secondary endpoint included several assessments:

* Number (and percentage) of subjects with microbiological eradication at the EOS, defined as achieving a quantitative urine culture at the EOS indicating a reduction of all uro-pathogens present at baseline to \<10\^5 colony forming unit per milliliter (CFU/mL) and the absence of baseline pathogens detected by EOS urine PCR (Cq \> 33);
* Subjective measurement of treating investigator satisfaction score through a questionnaire at EOS, evaluated factors such as the ease of interpreting the test result, its availability, and its usefulness in clinical decision-making and patient management compared to the comparator;

In military personnel, it can lead to military incapacity. This psychopathology is characterized by confrontation with one or more traumatic events in the individual's life history. Symptoms include cognitive and mood disorders, avoidance, hyperactivation (hypervigilance and anger) and intrusions (flashbacks and nightmares).

Studies show that the prevalence of PTSD in military personnel fluctuates considerably from one situation to another (pre-deployment/post-deployment, etc.). In these at-risk populations, the often more complex PTSD clinic may also account for the heterogeneity of prevalences observed. Nevertheless, PTSD tends to become chronic in military personnel, making it particularly difficult to return to a ""previous"" state. In French casualties, beyond the symptoms already mentioned, complaints focus on difficulties in social interaction situations involving others in social life (attachment style to others) and in everyday life (public transport, supermarket shopping, social interactions, presence of crowds...).

NCT06996262,Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and Processed Food,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06996262,,COMPLETED,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain a primary cause of chronic disability and mortality globally, with cardiometabolic risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and diabetes significantly contributing to their development. Poor nutrition is recognized as a modifiable key risk factor for CVD, representing a crucial area for prevention strategies. While current research often emphasizes overall dietary patterns and quality in CVD prevention, the spectrum of food processing, ranging from minimally processed to ultra-processed foods (UPFs), can profoundly influence diet quality.

Ultra-processed foods, characterized by industrial processing techniques, additives, and special industrial ingredients, have been shown to potentially compromise the health benefits of food by reducing essential nutrients and bioactive compounds, introducing unhealthy elements, and altering food structures. Emerging epidemiological evidence links higher UPF consumption to an increased risk of obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes, with studies like the Framingham Offspring Study indicating a positive association with CVD incidence.

Globally, UPF consumption is on the rise, constituting a significant portion of daily energy intake. In Turkey, data from the 2021 National Nutrition and Health Survey reveals that a substantial 58% of adults consume processed foods daily . This is particularly concerning given Turkey's high burden of CVD, which has been the leading cause of mortality for decades and is projected to increase further due to an aging population and rising rates of diabetes and obesity. Notably, Turkey has the highest rate of early myocardial infarction in Europe.

Given the increasing consumption of UPFs and their potential health implications, especially in a country with a high prevalence of CVD like Turkey, understanding the relationship between dietary factors and cardiovascular health is critical. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the association between processed food intake and cardiometabolic risk factors among adult individuals in Türkiye.",NO,Cardiac Disease|Cardiovascular Diseases|Nutrition|Nutritional Disease|Cardiometabolic Diseases|Cardiometabolic Risk Factors,OTHER: observational study|OTHER: observational study|OTHER: observational study|OTHER: observational study,"Biochemical Measurements - Fasting blood glucose, Fasting blood sugar (mg/dL) will be analyzed in the hospital biochemistry laboratory using routine methods from blood samples taken by a nurse., Baseline|Biochemical Measurement - Lipid Profile, Participants' biochemical tests (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, (mg/dL) were analyzed in the hospital biochemistry laboratory using routine methods at the beginning of the study from blood samples taken by a nurse after at least 12 hours of fasting and without consuming alcohol for 24 hours before., Baseline|Biochemical Measurements - HbA1C, Fasting blood sugar (mg/dL) was analyzed in the hospital biochemistry laboratory using routine methods from blood samples taken by a nurse at the beginning of the study., Baseline|Biochemical Measurements - Uric acid, Participants' serum uric acid tests (mg/dL) was analyzed in the hospital biochemistry laboratory using routine methods at the beginning of the study from blood samples taken by a nurse after at least 12 hours of fasting and without consuming alcohol for 24 hours before., Baseline|Blood Pressures, Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) includes auscultation of the brachial artery with a stethoscope to detect the appearance and muffled or absent Korotkoff sounds., Baseline|Framingham Risk Score, The Framingham Risk Score was used to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in participants.

NCT06996249,Prospective Data Collection Initiative on Thoracic Malignancies,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06996249,DuTOC,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Survival after cancer diagnosis strongly depends on local tumor extent, lymph node involvement and the presence of distant metastases. However, there remains great inter-patient variability regarding treatment outcome. A combination of molecular factors, biochemical factors, histopathological features, genomic profile, environmental factors and other clinical factors are likely to influence prognosis and treatment effect, independent from tumor stage. It is however still unclear which, how, and to what extent these factors will influence tumor recurrence and mortality in both early stage (I-III) and late stage (IV) thoracic malignancies such as lung cancer.

Although the results from prospective clinical trials will remain the backbone of evidence-based medicine, this concerns a highly selected patient population since the large majority (85%-95%) of patients with cancer do not participate in clinical trials for various reasons. It is unlikely that trial participation will significantly improve in the near future. This fact has the following implications:

1. It is highly desirable to validate the results from clinical trials in the general patient population. This is complicated by the fact that the documentation of patients treated in general practice (i.e. outside the scope of clinical trials) is largely insufficient to provide comparable patient cohorts in terms of prognostic characteristics and treatment parameters.
2. There is an ever increasing number of therapeutic interventions available for which its efficacy depends on known and unknown tumor-specific, clinical, demographic and other patient characteristics. Large numbers of patients are required to test the relevance of these variables.
3. As a result of rapid technical and drug developments, new minimally invasive treatment options such as stereotactic irradiation or ablation techniques or sublobar resections and new targeted and immunotherapeutic treatments have entered the clinic. These interventions have potentially less side effects compared to the conventional treatments. Still, these new interventions will have to prove their effectiveness, safety and superiority (or non-inferiority) in a real world setting.
4. Many hypotheses related to further optimization of personalized medicine can currently not be tested as they require a large prospective cohort of patients, and a less time-consuming and costly research infrastructure.

A prospective observational cohort study has the potential to fill the gap between prospective randomized trials (efficacy) and patients treated in general practice (effectiveness) and it will enable accrual of clinical trials (innovation).",NO,"Lung Cancer|Thoracic Cancer|Lung Cancer, Nonsmall Cell|Adenocarcinoma|Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Large Cell Lung Cancer|Thymus Cancer|Mesothelioma",BEHAVIORAL: Health-related quality of life and treatment outcome questionnaires|GENETIC: (Tumor) tissue and other biomaterials|PROCEDURE: Blood samples,"Progression free survival, up to 10 years","Disease free survival, up to 10 years|Overall survival, up to 10 years|Health related quality of life, QLQc30 questionnaire with a 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) scale, Baseline - 3 - 6 - 12 - 24 - 36 - ... months|Health related quality of life, EQ5D questionnaire with a 1 (no problems) to 5 (not able to) scale and 0 (worst) to100 (best) measurement scale, Baseline - 3 - 6 - 12 - 24 - 36 - ... months|Health related quality of life, LC-13 questionnaire with a 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) scale, Baseline - 3 - 6 - 12 - 24 - 36 - ... months",,Dutch Society of Physicians for Pulmonology and Tuberculosis,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,12000,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,Dutch Thoracic Oncology Cohort|NL-009157 / PI-01.01,2025-05-30,2029-01-01,2030-01-01,2025-05-30,,2025-05-30,"UMC Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",

Giving chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, melphalan, or busulfan, before a donor \[peripheral blood stem cell\] transplant helps kill cancer cells in the body and helps make room in the patient's bone marrow for new blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. When healthy stem cells for a donor are infused into a patient (allogeneic HCT), they may help the patient's bone marrow make more healthy cells and platelets. Allogeneic HCT is an established treatment, however, GVHD continues to be a major problem of allogeneic HCT that can complicate therapy. GVHD is a disease caused when cells from a donated stem cell graft attack the normal tissue of the transplant patient. Emapalumab binds to an immune system protein called interferon gamma. This may help lower the body's immune response and reduce inflammation. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Tacrolimus is a drug used to help reduce the risk of rejection by the body of organ and bone marrow transplants. Mycophenolate mofetil is a drug used to prevent GVHD after organ transplants. It is also being studied in the prevention of GVHD after stem cell transplants for cancer, and in the treatment of some autoimmune disorders. Mycophenolate mofetil is a type of immunosuppressive agent.

During this time, many parents use their phones and the Internet to seek out information and support. Thus, we are exploring the opportunity of using mHealth, or mobile health, to provide information directly to parents after the birth of their first baby. We have developed a program for both birthing and non-birthing parents called the Essential Coaching Postpartum program. This program provides 332 parents with text messages sent for 6 weeks after birth to share information on newborn care and parent outcomes. This will be tailored based on whether they are the birthing parent (Essential Coaching for Every Mother) or non-birthing parent (Essential Coaching for Every Partner). We will evaluate this program by comparing a group of parents who receive the messages to a group of parents do not receive any text messages. To determine the success of the Essential Coaching Postpartum program, we will compare parents' confidence, anxiety, depression, and co-parenting between the two groups after six-weeks and six-months. We believe that parents who get the text messages will have higher confidence and co-parenting outcomes and lower anxiety and depression.

NCT06996054,Effects of a Multifaceted School-Based Intervention to Protect Mental Health and Prevent Suicidal Behaviour in Adolescents in Spain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06996054,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"What is this study about? This study aims to find out if a school-based program can help improve mental health and prevent suicidal thoughts and behaviors in teenagers in Spain. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among young people. Many teens who think about or attempt suicide are also struggling with mental health problems like depression. Schools offer a unique opportunity to help because almost all adolescents attend school regularly.

What will happen in the study?

The study will include about 2,280 students aged 12 to 16 years from 38 secondary schools in the Balearic Islands, Spain. Schools will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

Intervention group: Students will participate in four weekly classroom sessions led by trained psychologists. These sessions will help students learn about mental health, manage their emotions, recognize signs of distress in themselves or others, and ask for help when needed. At the same time, parents and teachers will follow a digital training program with videos and resources to help them support students' mental health and recognize warning signs.

Control group: Students will receive a minimal intervention, which includes educational posters displayed in classrooms.

What is the purpose of this program? The main goal is to reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The program also aims to improve students' overall mental well-being, reduce depression symptoms, and encourage help-seeking behaviors. It also helps parents and teachers feel more confident in supporting teens who may be at risk.

How will the study be evaluated? Students will complete questionnaires at the start of the study and again after six months. These surveys will ask about mental health, suicidal thoughts, emotional well-being, self-harm, substance use, and experiences with bullying. Parents and teachers will also complete surveys about their knowledge and confidence in supporting students.

Why is this study important? There is an urgent need to find effective ways to prevent suicide and support young people's mental health. This program involves students, families, and schools in working together to create a safe and supportive environment. If the program works, it could be used in schools throughout Spain and possibly in other countries too.

NCT06995950,Improving Diagnosis of Legume Allergy in Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06995950,LACID,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"In France, almost 15% of serious food allergies in children are caused by legumes, especially peanuts. Other legumes like soy, lentils, peas, lupin, chickpeas, beans, and fenugreek can also cause allergic reactions.

But here's the problem: only peanuts, soy, and lupin are required to be clearly labeled on food packaging in the European Union. This makes it hard for families to know when other legumes-like peas or fenugreek-are hidden in processed foods.

At the same time, legumes are being used more and more. They are healthy, rich in protein, and better for the environment. In France, a 2019 law (called EGALIM) requires at least one vegetarian meal per week in schools, and these meals often use legumes to replace meat. To make them more appealing to kids, legumes are turned into foods that look familiar-like veggie nuggets or burgers. As a result, children are eating more legumes, often without knowing it.

Children who are allergic to peanuts are often also sensitised to other legumes. This is because the proteins in different legumes can be similar. But being ""sensitised"" doesn't mean a child will have a real allergic reaction when eating that food.

Previously, a retrospective study conducted in Nancy, France, looked at nearly 200 children allergic to peanuts. In this study, 2 out of 3 children were sensitised to at least one other legume, 1 out of 5 was truly allergic to another legume and allergy was confirmed in 16% of cases for fenugreek, 56% for lupin, and 45% for peas.

Avoiding all these legumes is hard-especially since many of them are used in processed foods and not always listed on the label. Lupin can be hidden in pastries, fenugreek is found in spice mixes and even some cheeses or medicines and peas are used in vegetarian dishes like veggie steaks or nuggets.

This makes everyday life stressful for allergic children and their families. Right now, the only sure way to know if a child is allergic to a food is to do a carefully supervised food oral challenge at the hospital. But scientists are trying to find easier, safer ways to diagnose legume allergies-so that children don't have to avoid foods unnecessarily.

So far, detailed allergy tests are available for peanuts and soy, but not for other legumes. LACID study has been created to find and study the proteins in lupin, fenugreek, and peas that may cause allergies and developp better allergy tests for these legumes-possibly as part of a diagnostic tool that can give clear results using just a blood sample.

This study provides early information on how well MCD tests perform as cancer screening tools and help researchers understand how patients and their doctors make decisions about their care when the MCD test comes back with a normal (negative) or an abnormal (positive) result. The goal of cancer screening is to reduce the burden of cancer by identifying cancers before they show symptoms or signs, ideally at an early stage where the chance of cure is highest, and treatment may be less aggressive. MCD is a test that measures tumor cell biomarkers in blood in order to screen for multiple cancers simultaneously. MCDs are simple to implement for both health care providers and their patients, making them accessible even in under-resourced settings. The Avantect MCD test is a next-generation sequencing (NGS)- based screening test intended for the qualitative detection of the presence or absence of cancer-related abnormal signals in plasma cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) derived from whole blood. The Avantect MCD test reports on the possible presence of 8 cancers: breast, colorectal, esophagus, stomach, liver, lung, ovarian and pancreas and may indicate the presence of up to two predicted tissue of origins. The Shield MCD blood test reports cancer derived alterations associated from whole blood samples collected from individuals at average risk. The Shield MCD test is developed for the detection of cancers and the prediction of the tissue of origin of 10 cancer types: bladder, breast, colorectal, esophageal, stomach, liver, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate.

NCT06995846,Application of Bacterial DNA Quantitative Detection in Diagnosis of SBP in Cirrhosis: A Multi Center Diagnostic Experiment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06995846,,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"Background and Significance:

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common and life-threatening complication in patients with liver cirrhosis, characterized by high incidence and mortality. The current diagnostic standard relies on ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count ≥250 cells/μL. However, this threshold is associated with high rates of missed diagnoses, poor correlation with clinical symptoms, and delays in pathogen identification due to the low sensitivity and prolonged time of traditional ascitic fluid culture.

With the development of molecular diagnostics, bacterial DNA (bactDNA) detection-especially through droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-has emerged as a promising technique due to its high sensitivity, absolute quantification capability, and robustness. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic value and accuracy of ddPCR-based quantification of bacterial DNA in ascitic fluid for SBP, providing a novel and objective diagnostic tool to improve early and accurate detection and to inform targeted antimicrobial therapy.

Objectives:

To assess the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values) of ddPCR-based quantification of total bacterial DNA in ascitic fluid for SBP.

To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the ratio of Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacterial DNA (G+/G-) in predicting SBP.

To explore the potential of ddPCR-based bacterial DNA quantification as a complementary or alternative method to conventional PMN-based diagnostic criteria.

Study Design and Methods:

This is a prospective diagnostic study involving 700 patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites. Ascitic fluid samples will be analyzed using ddPCR to quantify bacterial DNA levels. These results will be compared with traditional diagnostic criteria, including PMN counts and expert panel assessments based on clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. Statistical analyses will include correlation analysis, ROC curve analysis, and consistency testing.

Expected Outcomes:

The study aims to establish the clinical efficacy of ddPCR-based quantification of bacterial DNA in ascitic fluid as a novel diagnostic marker for SBP. This method is expected to be particularly useful in atypical cases where PMN counts are \<250/μL and may help guide preliminary antibiotic selection based on the proportion of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, thereby reducing empirical treatment failures and antibiotic resistance.",NO,Cirrhosis|Ascites|Bacterial Infections,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Bacterial DNA Levels in Ascites,"spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), The SBP diagnosis is based on PMN (2021 practice Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis.) a clinical composite diagnosis (2023 Chinese guidelines), From enrollment to the end of follow at 24 weeks",,,Beijing YouAn Hospital,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,700,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,LL-2024-034-K,2024-04-02,2025-12-31,2026-06-30,2025-05-30,,2025-05-30,"No. 8 You An Men Wai Street, Fengtai District, Beijing 100069, China, Beijing, China",

To date, digital climate change communications have been limited to one-directional, one size-fits all messaging based on a single theoretical approach (i.e., framing). This Phase I SBIR explored the acceptability and effects of an innovative solution: atlas - an interactive text messaging program that leverages insights from behavior change science and integrates data from the National Weather Service to engage a broad spectrum of users with varying levels of concern about climate change and tailor the user experience.

atlas 1) provided information on current climate-related and environmental risks (e.g., high temperatures, air quality alerts, asthma triggers etc.) that might adversely affect a user's current health conditions; 2) linked users to local zip-code matched resources to mitigate their specific risk (e.g., cooling centers, hurricane shelters); 3) implemented a full range of best practices in tailored health behavior change communications to personalize ongoing communications regarding the link between human actions and extreme weather based on the user's level of concern about and belief in climate change; and 4) provided customized actionable tips for addressing climate change to promote climate efficacy at the individual, community, and policy/advocacy level based on the user's level of motivation.

Developed in collaboration with community members, 2 community health experts, and 4 climate change experts, atlas achieved sustained engagement and impact by hyper-personalizing the user experience and seamlessly integrating actionable insights from multiple theories of behavior change and communication frameworks. Extensive end user and expert input ensured atlas was designed for rapid dissemination.

At present, the pathogenesis of HDP is not completely clear, and there is a lack of early effective early warning molecules and limited treatment methods. It is of great significance to find biomarkers that can predict the occurrence of HDP in early pregnancy and explore the pathogenesis of HDP in depth. Intestinal flora is a complex and huge microbial community existing in the digestive tract, which has the function of independent metabolism and plays a vital role in maintaining the dynamic balance of the body and promoting the occurrence and development of diseases. It is found that the intestinal flora and metabolites of pregnant women with HDP have changed significantly, and they are related to blood pressure and proteinuria. Supplementing intestinal microbial decomposition products (such as butyrate, propionate, etc.) in HDP rats can improve intestinal barrier function, inhibit inflammatory reaction, and then lower blood pressure. Therefore, the imbalance of intestinal flora and its metabolites can lead to intestinal barrier damage and activate inflammatory reaction, which may be an important cause of HDP.

Mostly a female cancer, it can affect a young population, with around 20% of breast cancers occurring in women under 50. Treatment is mainly based on surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapies and hormone therapy. Although chemotherapy is not systematically used, it remains a frequent treatment option. While chemotherapy makes a major contribution to curing cancer, it is also a source of potentially disabling side effects for survivors.

Chemotherapy can interfere with the normal functioning of the central nervous system, leading to cognitive impairment. The number of people potentially affected by chemobrain is estimated at several tens of millions worldwide. There is no recommended treatment for people with chemobrain. Several avenues have been explored, with very limited results. Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a non-medicinal treatment technique that combines all the biological, athermic and non-cytotoxic effects of tissue exposure to non-ionizing sources of red and infrared light. Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of cortical stimulation by photobiomodulation on memory (increased angiogenesis, increased oxygenation of brain tissue via vasodilatation, and increased mitochondrial ATP production).

NCT06995352,Liposomal Bupivacaine Versus Continuous Peripheral Nerve Blocks for Analgesia Following Ankle Surgery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06995352,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Postoperative pain remains undertreated. Opioids have well-known limitations for both individuals and society, and while single-injection peripheral nerve blocks with unencapsulated local anesthetic provide potent analgesia, their duration is measured in hours while post-surgical pain usually outlasts this duration. Continuous peripheral nerve blocks prolong analgesia but may possibly be replaced with liposomal bupivacaine with a reported duration of up to 72-96 hours (Schwartz. J Clin Anesth 2024). In comparison to continuous peripheral nerve blocks, liposomal bupivacaine eliminates a time-consuming catheter insertion as well as the risks of catheter dislodgement, localized infection, local anesthetic leakage, and infusion pump malfunction. Furthermore, liposomal bupivacaine significantly reduces the burden on both patients and healthcare providers as it does not require the use of a portable infusion pump, local anesthetic reservoir, or perineural catheter to be carried, managed, or eventually removed. Notably, the potential for local anesthetic-induced myotoxicity, and cardiac/neurologic toxicity is reduced or negated altogether. And the cost of liposome bupivacaine is less than the combined cost of a catheter set, insertion equipment, portable infusion pump, large reservoir of local anesthetic, and healthcare provider oversight.

Therefore, should a single injection of liposomal bupivacaine be demonstrated to provide at least non-inferior analgesia and opioid sparing as a continuous peripheral nerve block, it would be a far superior analgesic benefiting patients, providers, hospitals, and payers such as Medicare and private health insurance. Randomized, active-controlled clinical trials are required to compare the newer liposomal bupivacaine to continuous peripheral nerve blocks. The ultimate objective of the proposed research study is to determine if liposomal bupivacaine in a peripheral nerve block is at least non-inferior to a continuous peripheral nerve block following moderate-to-severely painful ankle surgery.

This is a single-center clinical trial. The investigators will randomize participants to either a liposomal bupivacaine combined with unencapsulated bupivacaine single-injection popliteal-sciatic and saphenous nerve block group, or single injections of unencapsulated bupivacaine followed by a continuous popliteal-sciatic bupivacaine infusion.",NO,Moderate-to-severely Painful Ankle Surgery,DRUG: Popliteal nerve block including liposomal bupivacaine|DRUG: Adductor canal nerve block including liposomal bupivacaine|DRUG: Continuous popliteal nerve block with normal saline|DRUG: Popliteal nerve block with exclusively unencapsulated bupivacaine|DRUG: Adductor canal nerve block with exclusively unencapsulated bupivacaine|DRUG: Continuous popliteal nerve block with unencapsulated bupivacaine,"First postoperative week daily average pain level, The NRS is a highly-sensitive measure of pain intensity with numbers ranging from 0 to 10, zero equivalent to no pain and 10 equivalent to the worst imaginable pain.

NCT06995274,Umbilical Cord Blood Therapy in a Child With Eosinophilic Duodenitis and Autism Spectrum Disorder: a Case Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06995274,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"This single-case exploratory clinical study aims to evaluate the therapeutic potential of umbilical cord blood (UCB) infusion in a pediatric patient diagnosed with both eosinophilic duodenitis (ED) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ED is a rare inflammatory gastrointestinal condition characterized by excessive eosinophil infiltration in the duodenal mucosa, often associated with immune hypersensitivity and allergic responses. ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder marked by deficits in social interaction, communication, and behavioral flexibility. Recent evidence suggests a link between gastrointestinal inflammation and neurodevelopmental symptoms via the gut-brain axis, especially in patients with co-occurring ASD and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs).

In this study, the patient will receive three UCB infusions: one autologous and two allogeneic. The first (autologous) UCB is stored at a certified cord blood bank and will be administered intravenously. Subsequently, two allogeneic UCB infusions will be administered six weeks apart using HLA-matched donor units selected from a hospital-based cord blood repository. The cell product will contain a minimum of 3 × 10⁷ total nucleated cells per kg, and donor-recipient compatibility for HLA A, B, and DRB1 will be considered.

To support immune tolerance and reduce potential adverse responses, a 7-day course of low-dose oral cyclosporine will be administered with each allogeneic infusion. All cord blood handling, thawing, and infusion will be performed in a cell therapy center under standardized protocols.

The primary aim is to explore the immune regulatory effects and symptom relief following UCB therapy in this rare comorbid case. Assessments will include brain MRI with DTI, EEG, fNIRS, sensory profiles (SP), social communication questionnaires (SCQ), autism rating scales (K-CARS-2), behavioral checklists (CBCL), gastrointestinal endoscopy, and developmental/cognitive/language assessments (e.g., WISC, WPPSI, GMFM, VMI, SELSI, PRES, FIM). Blood samples will be analyzed for eosinophil counts and gene/protein expression related to inflammation, neuroendocrine function, and gut-brain signaling (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, serotonin, dopamine, GABA, CRH, BDNF).

This case study will also track safety indicators including vital signs, laboratory panels, and adverse events.

The goal of this study is to evaluate how well a personalized dosing regimen of a hormone called Follitropin delta works in women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) for in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using a long GnRH agonist protocol.

Follitropin delta is a recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) that allows for individualized dosing based on a woman's weight and a blood marker called anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). This personalized approach may help to better balance the stimulation of the ovaries, aiming to reduce the risk of overstimulation (OHSS) while still achieving good treatment outcomes.

The study will include approximately 350 women who are undergoing routine IVF/ICSI treatment. No experimental drugs or procedures are involved. All treatment decisions remain the responsibility of the attending physicians and follow standard clinical practice. Data will be collected only from routine visits and medical documentation, with no additional interventions required for participation.

Researchers will analyze outcomes such as the number of eggs retrieved, pregnancy rates, treatment cancellations, and any side effects. The study will also look at whether certain patient characteristics can predict how well the treatment works or whether complications may arise.

Participation is voluntary. All personal data will be pseudonymized and handled according to strict data protection regulations (GDPR).

NCT06995222,The Role of Renal Resistive Index (RI) in Predicting Acute Kidney Injury Progression in Intensive Care Clinic,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06995222,,RECRUITING,"Acute kidney injury(AKI) is defined in the KDIGO guidelines as a ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5 micromol/L) increase in serum creatinine in the previous 48 hours or a ≥1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine from baseline, known or presumed to have occurred in the previous seven days, or a urine volume \<0.5 mL/kg/hour for six hours.

Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with AKI, many investigators are studying several novel biomarkers to detect AKI progression earlier, identify etiologies and predict outcomes. However, the utilisation of these novel biomarkers may be constrained by reimbursement considerations.

The renal resistive index (RRI) is a well-established metric for evaluating renal perfusion; however, its application in the context of AKI has been a subject of recent debate. While RRI has been utilised to demonstrate perfusion in acute and chronic renal diseases, particularly in conjunction with ultrasonography, its efficacy remains a subject of scientific discourse. In addition, Boddi reported that RRI is a strong indicator of mortality and a diagnostic marker, especially in patients with persistent AKI.

This project consists of two phases, methodological and randomized controlled experimental study. The first stage, in which ReLiver-N App will be developed, is planned as a methodological study, and the second stage, in which the effect of ReLiver-N App on hepatic rehabilitation will be evaluated, as a randomized controlled single-blind experimental study. ReLiver-N App will be developed in line with the steps of the Design Based Research Model. The sample size of the project is planned to consist of 56 patients with liver cirrhosis. Patients with a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, 18 years of age and older, with the severity of the disease in Child Pugh A and B categories, without verbal or written communication barriers, with a smart phone, and who consented to participate in the study will constitute the sample. Pre-tests will be applied by face-to-face interview method. Assignment of patients to intervention and control groups will be made by block randomization. While patients in the intervention group access all the content of ReLiver-N App; patients in the control group will not have access to any data on the intervention. It is planned that the project will be implemented for 90 days and follow up evaluations will be made every month. Follow up assessments and post-test data will be available online via the ReLiver-N App. The dependent variable of the project is hepatic rehabilitation, and the independent variable is ReLiver-N Intervention Protocol.",NO,Liver Cirrhosis,BEHAVIORAL: ReLiver-N App,"Patient Activation-Patient Activation Measure, 12 weeks|Self-efficacy, Self-efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6-item Scale, 12 weeks|Quality of life - Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire, 12 weeks",,,Akdeniz University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,52,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE,TÜBİTAK 123S032|123S032,2025-01-10,2025-07-09,2025-08-01,2025-05-29,,2025-05-29,"Akdeniz University, Antalya, 07070, Turkey",
NCT06995183,Heart CT Imaging to Detect Early Coronary Artery Disease in First-Degree Relatives With High or Low Lipoprotein(a) Identified Through Family Screening,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06995183,IMAGE-LPA,RECRUITING,"Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is a type of cholesterol that can increase the risk of heart and blood vessel disease. Many people are unaware they have high Lp(a), since it is not routinely measured and usually causes no symptoms on its own. However, elevated Lp(a) levels tend to run in families, meaning that close relatives of individuals with high Lp(a) are more likely to have it as well.

At Amsterdam UMC, family members of patients with high Lp(a) are invited for cascade screening, which includes testing for Lp(a) and other cardiovascular risk factors. From this screened group, a selection of individuals with either high or low Lp(a) levels are invited to participate in the IMAGE-LPA study.

In IMAGE-LPA, participants undergo a comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation, including blood tests and heart imaging using CT scans. Two types of scans are performed: (1) a calcium score scan to detect early calcium buildup in the heart's arteries (an early marker of atherosclerosis), and (2) coronary CT angiography to assess for plaque and narrowing in the coronary arteries.

The goal of the study is to compare individuals with high versus low Lp(a) identified through cascade screening, to determine whether high Lp(a) levels are associated with early signs of heart disease in this patient group.

The study does not involve any medications or invasive procedures. The findings may help clarify whether heart imaging can improve early detection in individuals with high Lp(a), and guide future strategies for preventing cardiovascular disease in families affected by this inherited risk factor.",NO,Lipoprotein(a),,"Number of Participants with Coronary Atherosclerotic Plaque Detected on CCTA, Assessment of the presence or absence of any coronary artery plaque as detected by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).

NCT06995157,Characteristics of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infections and HPV Vaccine Attitudes Among Slovenian Women After the Introduction of HPV Vaccination,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06995157,,RECRUITING,"Cervical cancer (CC), primarily caused by persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types, remains a significant public health issue. Despite the availability of prophylactic HPV vaccines and improved screening methods, vaccination coverage and uptake remain suboptimal in many countries, including Slovenia. In 2020, the WHO launched a global strategy to eliminate CC, emphasizing 90% HPV vaccination coverage among girls, 70% screening of women at key ages, and 90% treatment of identified cases by 2030.

The EVEN FASTER concept proposes that targeting a specific age group of women-those bridging unvaccinated and vaccinated cohorts-with simultaneous HPV screening and vaccination may significantly reduce HPV transmission. Swedish data support this, showing a 62-64% reduction in high-risk HPV infections following combined interventions in women aged 23-30.

In Slovenia, HPV vaccination has been available since 2006 for girls, and since 2021 for boys, with average uptake around 50%. However, no comparable model has been implemented or studied locally. This proposed clinical study will assess HPV vaccine acceptability among women in Slovenia, identify barriers to uptake, define an optimal target age group for intervention, and evaluate the effectiveness of offering concurrent screening and vaccination to accelerate CC prevention in this region.

Women will be invited to participate during their preventive gynecological examination within Slovenia's national cervical cancer screening program (ZORA). Inclusion criteria include regular cervical smears (CS) every 3 years following a previously normal result, first or second CS after entering the ZORA program, follow-up CS after abnormal cytology, non-neoplastic findings, or cervical procedures, and CS due to clinical indications. Exclusion criteria include pregnancy, menstruation, cervical or vaginal inflammation, other medical conditions preventing CS collection, prior hysterectomy, prior CS taken for this study, or known hypersensitivity to HPV vaccine components.

Eligible women will be invited by the attending gynecologist and nurse. After the exam, participants will complete an anonymous questionnaire covering demographics, screening history, vaccination status, and vaccine attitudes. Assistance will be provided if needed.

Women aged ≤35 who are unvaccinated will receive counseling on HPV vaccination, including benefits and risks. Those consenting will receive free vaccination with the nonavalent Gardasil®9 vaccine, following a three-dose schedule (0, 1-2, 6 months).

Around 500 women aged ≤35 are expected in this sub-group, with fewer than half anticipated to accept vaccination.

In CT-guided SBRT, x-ray-based imaging and cone-beam CTs are used to define and localize the area to be treated with SBRT. SBRT is a type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position a patient and precisely deliver radiation to tumors in the body (except the brain). The total dose of radiation is divided into smaller doses given over several days. This type of radiation therapy helps spare normal tissue. A recent randomized trial showed that while SBRT is associated with less urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction than complete surgical removal of the prostate, there are more urinary irritative side effects and more bowel side effects than with surgery. One source of uncertainty in SBRT that may contribute to genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) side effects is the necessity of treating a ""margin"" of volume around the prostate to account for its movement during SBRT. Intrafraction motion monitoring is any technique or system designed to track the movement of the body and target during fractions of external beam radiation to keep the beam on target. This allows for the patient to be repositioned, if needed, to ensure delivery of the SBRT to only the planned treatment area. CT-guided SBRT with intrafraction motion monitoring may lower GU and GI side effects by allowing tighter margins, as has been demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided SBRT.",NO,Localized Prostate Adenocarcinoma|Stage I Prostate Cancer AJCC v8|Stage II Prostate Cancer AJCC v8|Stage III Prostate Cancer AJCC v8,PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|RADIATION: CT-guided Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy|OTHER: Intrafraction Motion Monitoring|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration,"Incidence of acute grade ≥ 2 genitourinary (GU) toxicities, Will determine physician-scored GU toxicities by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5 (CTCAE v5.0) criteria.

NCT06994702,Impact of the MRI Restraint System on the Quality of the Synthetic Scan for Intracranial Radiotherapy Treatment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06994702,ISTRI,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"In radiotherapy, CT scans are the reference imaging tool for treatment planning, as they provide the electron density of the tissues required to calculate the dose. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is used as a complement to CT to contour target volumes and organs at risk. While the properties of CT allow us to determine the electron density of tissues, the properties of MRI allow us to determine the proton density of tissues. MRI therefore provides better tissue contrast, but cannot be used directly to calculate the dose. In recent years, MRI-only protocols have been introduced to remove the need for a CT examination and avoid possible MRI-CT registration errors. Dose calculations are then performed on MRI images converted into synthetic CT images (sCT) using software based on artificial intelligence (for the most recent). Various commercial solutions are available for generating these sCTs, and the ICO already has experience of evaluating them.

While MRI scans for diagnostic purposes are performed in the free position, the generation of an sCT for treatment preparation requires the MRI scan to be performed in the radiotherapy position. For cranial lesions, a thermoformed mask fixed to the table is made for each patient. Depending on the type of treatment and its associated degree of precision, different types of mask exist at the ICO: '3-point' for normo-fractionated treatments and 'stereo' for treatments of 1 to 3 fractions. The use of these masks during the MRI examination can interfere with the correct positioning of the antennae and thus lead to a deterioration in the quality of the images obtained (MRI and, by repercussion, sCT).

NCT06994598,Investigation of Respiratory Muscle Sarcopenia in Geriatric Individuals,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06994598,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"The increase in the elderly population worldwide necessitates further research on age-related physiological changes and health problems related to these changes in geriatric individuals. One of these problems, sarcopenia, is a syndrome characterized by a decrease in muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance due to aging (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). Sarcopenia affects not only the extremity muscles but also the respiratory muscles, significantly reducing the individual's functional capacity and quality of life (Shafiee et al., 2017). Sarcopenia is a progressive and widespread loss of skeletal muscles, characterized by a decrease in muscle strength, muscle mass, and physical performance. Although it is usually seen in older individuals, it can also occur in people with certain diseases or who lead a sedentary lifestyle. The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) has developed a guideline for the diagnosis of sarcopenia and determination of its severity (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2019). In line with this guideline, the EWGSOP considers sarcopenia in three basic stages: pre-sarcopenia, sarcopenia, and severe sarcopenia (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2010). Pre-sarcopenia is the stage in which muscle mass is low but muscle strength or physical performance is not yet affected. Sarcopenia is the stage in which low muscle mass is accompanied by decreased muscle strength or low physical performance. Severe sarcopenia is defined as the most advanced stage in which all these criteria are met (Cruz-Jentoft et al., 2010). Respiratory muscle sarcopenia is defined as muscle fiber atrophy and weakness in the respiratory muscles. The Japanese Respiratory Sarcopenia Study Group defines this condition as whole-body sarcopenia with low respiratory muscle mass, decreased respiratory muscle strength, and/or respiratory dysfunction (Nagano et al., 2021). Kera et al. (2019) evaluated respiratory muscle sarcopenia according to the peak expiratory flow rate value. However, whole-body sarcopenia and respiratory muscle strength are considered important parameters in the definition and diagnosis of respiratory muscle sarcopenia. It is reported that the rate of respiratory muscle sarcopenia is higher in the presence of sarcopenia (Nagano et al., 2021). Sarcopenic respiratory failure is diagnosed in the presence of sarcopenia accompanied by functional disability, while individuals without functional disability but at risk for respiratory muscle sarcopenia are considered ""at risk of sarcopenic respiratory failure"" (Nagano et al., 2021). Sarcopenia is thought to be associated with insulin resistance and oxidative stress, leading to decreased muscle strength and muscle mass, as well as muscle atrophy (Ding et al., 2019). Respiratory muscles may also be affected in a similar way. Thus, weakening of respiratory muscles may lead to decreased respiratory function and decreased quality of life. In the current literature, studies examining the effects of aging on respiratory muscles are limited. Therefore, determining the potential effects of aging on respiratory muscles and evaluating respiratory muscle sarcopenia in this context may provide an important contribution to the development of new approaches and the literature.",NO,Geriatric|Sarcopenia|Diaphragm,,"Respiratory Muscle Sarcopenia Assessment, The diagnosis of respiratory muscle sarcopenia will also be made by combining the results of secondary measurements.

Our participants test scores will be recorded in seconds using a stopwatch., Baseline|4 Meter Walking Speed Test (4MWT), 4MWT is a measure of walking speed, a vital sign of mobility and functionality. In older adults, walking speed is a clinical indicator of conditions such as frailty and sarcopenia. Participants were instructed to start walking at their normal speed 2 m behind the ""start point"" and continue until they passed the ""end point"". Using a stopwatch, the time taken for each participant to walk the 4 m distance between the ""start"" and ""end"" point will be measured. This will be used to calculate walking speed (distance/time)., Baseline|Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), This functional test measures the time it takes for an individual to stand up from a standard chair, walk 3 m at normal speed, turn around, walk back to the starting point and sit down.

NCT06994559,Music as an Adjunct to Ketamine Therapy for Chronic Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06994559,MusKiP,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Intravenous (IV) ketamine is a treatment option for patients with chronic pain that does not respond to standard therapies, primarily working by blocking NMDA receptors in the brain. Beyond pain relief, ketamine can produce dissociative sensations, classifying it as an atypical psychedelic or mind-altering drug, and may enable patients to reprocess their pain similarly to experiences with traditional psychedelics. At the Montreal General Hospital's pain clinic, the investigators have observed patients frequently listening to music during ketamine infusions, and recent research indicates that music-especially when self-selected by patients-might provide additional pain-relieving benefits by influencing central mechanisms related to pain perception and interpretation. This intersection of music and pain relief is garnering substantial scientific interest as recent advances provide more insight into the neuroscience of music and its effects on brain regions involved in emotion, sensation, memory, and pain.

This study aims to investigate the effects of music on chronic pain patients undergoing IV ketamine infusions at the Alan Edwards Pain Management Unit (AEPMU), specifically to determine whether the choice of music affects the intensity and duration of ketamine-induced pain relief. During the infusion (lasting 1 hour), patients will listen to a playlist delivered through specialized headphones, which will either consist of their own selected music (preferred music), music chosen by a music therapist, or no music at all, in a randomized order. Patients will track their pain levels throughout the infusion period and in the intervals between treatments (5 weeks) using standardized pain assessment tools. Additionally, the investigators will assess the subjective experiences of ketamine through interviews and qualitative analysis, while documenting and summarizing any adverse effects.

The investigators hypothesize that listening to preferred music will enhance both the intensity and duration of pain relief from IV ketamine. To test this, the investigators will recruit patients already receiving repeated IV ketamine infusions for pain management at the AEPMU clinic. The first infusion will take place under usual conditions to establish a baseline.

NCT06994533,Comparative Study on Different Bone Reconstruction After Chest Wall Tumor Resection,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06994533,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Chest wall tumors are one of the important diseases in thoracic surgery, and surgery is still the main treatment for this disease in clinical practice. Surgery for chest wall tumors requires extensive resection. However, the extensive chest wall defect formed after extensive resection can lead to the destruction of the integrity and stability of the chest wall, thus requiring chest wall reconstruction. The reconstruction of the chest wall after resection has always been a difficult point in chest wall tumor surgery, and the reconstruction of the chest wall bone is a key point in chest wall reconstruction. The goals of successful chest wall bone reconstruction include restoring chest wall rigidity, minimizing chest wall deformities, maintaining lung mechanics, and protecting thoracic organs.

Purpose of the Study:

This study aims to investigate the value of new imaging technologies in assessing early graft function in patients who have undergone liver transplantation. By analyzing clinical, imaging, laboratory, and pathological data from liver transplant patients, the study seeks to establish a non-invasive method for diagnosing, evaluating treatment efficacy, and predicting outcomes related to graft function.

Background:

Liver transplantation is a critical treatment for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. While it significantly improves patients' quality of life and survival rates, complications such as graft dysfunction can occur post-surgery. Traditional methods for assessing graft function, including liver function tests, imaging studies (like ultrasound and CT), and biopsy, have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, there is a need for safer, non-invasive techniques that can provide a comprehensive assessment of graft function.

Study Design:

Type: Prospective study Participants: 1000 liver transplant patients who meet specific inclusion criteria, such as undergoing MR imaging post-transplant.

Exclusion Criteria: Patients with contraindications for MRI, such as implanted devices or claustrophobia.

Methods:

Participants will undergo MRI scans using advanced techniques like diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to evaluate graft function. Clinical and laboratory data will also be collected for comprehensive analysis.

Potential Benefits:

This study aims to enhance the early detection of graft dysfunction, allowing for timely interventions that could improve patient outcomes and prolong graft survival.

Risks and Safeguards:

While there is a risk of privacy breaches regarding patient data, all information will be handled confidentially and used solely for research purposes. Patient identities will be protected throughout the study.

NCT06994403,Glycemic Response to Carbob-Enriched Pasta in Healthy and With Type 1 Diabetes People,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06994403,GR-CEP,RECRUITING,"Carob (Ceratonia siliqua) is a fruit traditionally used in various Mediterranean countries for the preparation of sweets and beverages. Its pulp, once the seeds are removed, is milled into carob flour, a nutrient-rich food containing fiber, carbohydrates, proteins, and essential minerals such as potassium, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus, and calcium. Carob flour is also naturally sweet and can serve as a cocoa powder substitute in desserts. Furthermore, it is a source of polyphenols with known antioxidant properties.

Clinical evidence suggests that consumption of foods rich in refined carbohydrates is associated with elevated postprandial blood glucose levels, which are recognized as an independent cardiovascular risk factor. The glycemic index (GI) is a useful parameter to assess the impact of carbohydrate-containing foods on postprandial glycemic response. Based on carbohydrate quality, foods are classified as having high, medium, or low GI. Consumption of high-GI foods leads to a stronger glycemic response and has been linked to increased risk of chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.

Given its bromatological profile, carob flour may have the potential to modulate postprandial glycemic responses. However, studies evaluating the GI of carob-based products have shown inconsistent findings. In one randomized trial involving 10 healthy adults, a carob-based snack demonstrated a lower GI (40) compared to a chocolate cookie with an equivalent carbohydrate content (GI 78), using glucose as the reference. The same study found that consuming the carob snack before a meal led to a reduced postprandial glycemic response, decreased hunger, and lower caloric intake at an ad libitum meal. Another study on 7 healthy individuals reported a GI of 39 for carob flour bars containing 26 g of available carbohydrates. Conversely, a study involving 20 healthy participants found that consuming 5 or 10 g of carob pulp with 200 mL of water and 50 g glucose increased postprandial glycemic and insulinemic responses compared to water and glucose alone. This effect was not observed with a 20 g dose of carob pulp.

Among carbohydrate-rich foods, pasta represents a key component of the Italian diet and, due to its physical structure, generally has a low-to-moderate GI. Compared to other wheat-based foods like bread, pasta tends to produce a lower postprandial glycemic response when carbohydrate content is matched. However, the impact of adding carob flour to durum wheat semolina in pasta production on postprandial glycemia remains unexplored.

The current research project consists of two studies. The first study aims to determine the glycemic index of carob-enriched durum wheat pasta in healthy adult volunteers, using white bread as the reference food. The second study investigates the postprandial glycemic response to the same carob-enriched pasta in individuals with type 1 diabetes, comparing it to traditional durum wheat pasta.

Periodic limb movements (PLMS) are defined as a series of at least four consecutive limb movements, each separated by an inter-movement interval of 5 to 90 seconds. The PLMI is computed by dividing the total number of PLMS by the total sleep time in hours, yielding PLMS per hour of sleep (PLMS/h). A PLMI greater than 15 per hour in adults is considered clinically significant for periodic limb movement disorder., PSG will be measured at baseline, at the end of the ten-day treatment.","Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Addendum for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PSQI-A), A possible confounder to be controlled for will be assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Addendum for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PSQI-A) addresses patients exposed to trauma and was validated in U.S. male military veterans (Insana et al., 2013) and also in Portuguese by Gonçalves and Lima (2014). Seven items assess the frequency of hot flashes; general nervousness; memories or nightmares of the traumatic experience; severe anxiety or panic, not related to traumatic memories; nightmares, not related to traumatic memories; episodes of terror or screaming during sleep without full awakening; and episodes of staged dreams (Germain et al., 2005).

The PSQI-A (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Addendum for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder) ranges from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate a poorer outcome in PTSD symptom severity and a worse sleep quality.

NCT06994364,Psoas Muscle Release in Non-specific Mechanical Low Back Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06994364,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Nonspecific low back pain affects approximately 80% of the population at some point in their lives.

The psoas muscle-positioned between the lumbar and pelvic regions-together with the paravertebral muscles, constitutes the primary muscular group responsible for dynamic stabilization of the spine. Alterations in this muscle may contribute to the onset of low back pain by modifying spinal biomechanics, particularly through increased lumbar lordosis and greater mechanical overload in the lumbar region.

Latent myofascial trigger points are asymptomatic but can lead to muscle shortening and weakness. They are characterized by local tenderness and may provoke a localized muscular response known as a local twitch response.

The aim of this randomized experimental study was to evaluate the immediate effect of ischemic compression applied to the trigger point of the psoas muscle on pain perception and lumbar range of motion.

Researchers will compare a group with a placebo technique to see if the release of the psoas muscle produces effects in this condition.

The variables analyzed in this study included low back pain, assessed using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS); lateral lumbar flexion (right and left), measured using a tape measure (distance from the third finger to the floor); and lumbar flexion range of motion, assessed using the Schober test.",NO,Low Back Pain,OTHER: Trigger point release|OTHER: Simulation of the intestinal listening technique.,"Low back pain, Low back pain was evaluated using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), a widely used unidimensional instrument for assessing pain intensity in adults.

For lateral flexion, the participant stood upright and performed lateral flexion to the right, with the evaluator measuring the distance from the third finger to the floor. The same procedure was repeated for the left side.

The Modified Schober Test was used to assess lumbar flexion. With the participant standing, the evaluator identified the posterior superior iliac spines (PSIS) and marked a point 15 cm above it. The participant then performed maximal forward trunk flexion with knees extended, and the distance between the two marks was measured.

When SIC is persistent and cannot be corrected, it often sequentially develops into disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with multiple organ failure. Nafamostat mesylate can be used as an anticoagulant during blood purification in critically ill patients and is also used to treat SIC.Safe and effective anticoagulation is a prerequisite for the success of blood purification therapy. For patients with active bleeding or at risk of bleeding, how to achieve extracorporeal anticoagulation without affecting the body's coagulation function is a major clinical challenge. Nafamostat mesylate can reduce the risk of bleeding during blood purification, but its impact on the survival outcomes of patients with SIC undergoing blood purification therapy remains unclear.The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of nafamostat mesylate treatment on the prognosis of patients with sepsis-induced coagulopathy undergoing hemofiltration.",NO,Sepsis-induced Coagulopathy (SIC),DRUG: Nafamostat Mesylate|DRUG: sodium citrate,"ICU Mortality Rates, The proportion of patients who died during the ICU stay out of the total number of patients in the group., Through study completion, an average of 1 year","Average Filter Lifespan, The total sum of all filter usage times for each patient divided by the number of filters used., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|ICU length of stay, Length of Stay in the ICU, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|28-day mortality, The proportion of patients who died within 28 days out of the total number of patients in the group., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Incidence of Bleeding, The proportion of patients experiencing bleeding events (such as cerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, etc.) during the ICU stay out of the total number of patients., Through study completion, an average of 1 year",,The First Hospital of Jilin University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,282,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,Yuting Li 20250430,2025-07-01,2028-05-01,2028-12-01,2025-05-29,,2025-05-29,,

The study also evaluates whether a motivational phone call one month after therapy initiation improves CPAP adherence at the three-month follow-up. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Are phenotypic and psychological traits associated with adherence to CPAP therapy after 3 months of treatment?
* Can a single motivational telephone intervention, one month after initiating CPAP therapy, significantly improve CPAP adherence at the three-month follow-up compared to no intervention? Researchers will compare patients who receive a phone call to those who do not, to see if this simple intervention leads to better CPAP adherence after three months of use.

NCT06994156,Diagnostic and Prognostic Salivary Biomarkers in Chronic Muscle Pain,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06994156,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"A large proportion of the adult population worldwide currently lives with chronic muscle pain, with more than half of those affected experiencing pain localized to the face and jaw. This means that approximately 10-15% of the adult population is affected. Living with chronic muscle pain impacts many aspects of life, significantly affecting both the individual's quality of life and well-being as well as that of their close relations.

As with other chronic pain conditions, researchers agree that multiple factors contribute to the development and aggravation of the condition. The aim of this project is to identify proteins in saliva that are involved in the disease process of chronic muscle pain, in order to better understand the underlying mechanisms, improve prognosis assessment, and ultimately develop more effective treatments.

The project includes patients with localized chronic jaw muscle pain, those with generalized chronic pain (fibromyalgia), and pain-free individuals in a matched control group. Validated questionnaires are used to assess pain, including measures of physical and emotional function, followed by a clinical examination. Chewing-stimulated saliva is selected for sampling based on previous studies from the research group, and blood samples are collected from all participants. Proteins involved in metabolism, stress, and immunity will be analyzed, building on prior research conducted by the group. Patients will undergo conventional orofacial pain treatment and will later be followed up with new samples to study changes in protein expression following successful treatment.

Chronic muscle pain is one of the leading causes of work incapacity and long-term sick leave. This project combines clinical examinations with advanced biomedical analysis methods to investigate the role of specific proteins in disease development. The goal is to identify proteins involved in pain mechanisms to improve diagnostics and enable personalized treatments.

Methods: This research was designed as a cross-sectional study and conducted between December 2024 and May 2025. The study enrolled three cohorts: a case cohort comprising patients diagnosed with rheumatic disease as patient group (group 1); a disease control cohort of knee osteoarthritis (group 2), and a reference control cohort of age- and sex-matched healthy participants (group 3). Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) was administered to patients with rheumatoid arthritis; Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) was administered to patients with ankylosing spondylitis; Psoriatic Arthritis Disease Activity Index (DAPSA) was administered to patients with psoriatic arthritis; Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) was administered to patients with knee osteoarthritis; and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Turkey Health Literacy Scale-32 (THLS-32), Rational Drug Use Scale (RDUS), and Cyberchondria Severity Scale (CSS) were administered to all participants.

Results: The study sample consisted of 228 participants, with 76 individuals assigned to each of the three groups. Mean age, and gender distribution were similar in all three groups. Statistically significant variations were observed across the three groups regarding THLS-32, RDUS, and CSS scores (p \< 0.001). Group 1 had the highest HL and RDUS scores, and moderate CSS scores. In contrast, Group 2 showed the lowest HL and RDUS scores, while Group 3 demonstrated the highest CSS scores. HL was positively correlated with RDU (r = 0.552, p \< 0.001), and moderately negatively correlated with cyberchondria (r = -0.448, p \< 0.001). These results indicate that higher HL is associated with more rational medication behavior and reduced susceptibility to online health-related anxiety. (p\< 0.001).

Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to simultaneously investigate RDU and CSS in individuals diagnosed with RA, AS, and knee osteoarthritis. Our findings demonstrate that higher levels of HL are significantly associated with more appropriate medication behaviors and lower levels of internet-related health anxiety. These results emphasize the multidimensional role of HL, not only in promoting RDU but also in mitigating maladaptive digital health information-seeking patterns.",NO,"Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Knee Osteoarthritis",,"Turkey Health Literacy Scale-32 (THLS-32), Developed and validated by Okyay and colleagues \[35\], the THLS-32 measures HL levels.

The pathogenesis of the disease is a dynamic process that develops as a result of complex interactions between pathogenic bacteria and the host response . There is a bidirectional relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM), which is among the systemic diseases that negatively affect the host immune response, and periodontal disease. In the case of DM, long-term hyperglycemia causes proteins to react irreversibly with glucose, resulting in the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). It is suggested that increased AGE levels increase cytokine secretion against periodontopathogens, exacerbate inflammatory tissue destruction, and may negatively affect biological functions through cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in the connective tissue.

NCT06993766,The Predictability of CD19 Expression Across Primitive Cellular Fractions of Relapsed B-ALL on Outcomes of CD19-targeted CAR T-cells,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06993766,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant proliferation of immature lymphoid cells within the bone marrow, blood, and extramedullary sites. According to the SEER Cancer Statistics Review, the incidence was estimated to be at around 1·6 per 100000 people in 2014, with around 6000 new cases diagnosed in 2018. This disease is more frequent in children aged 1-4 years, then drops reaching the lowermost point between 25 years and 45 years. Generally, around 60% of ALL cases are diagnosed before the age of 20 years. Despite significant improvements in 5-year overall survival reaching around 90% in children, only 25% of patients older than 50 years old were alive 5 years after diagnosis1,2. These survival figures are much worse when dealing with relapsed disease. Cases of relapsed or refractory ALL are usually offered allogeneic stem cell transplantation that can establish meaningful disease control after achieving the best disease control depicted in lack of measurable residual disease3. However, the inability of performing allogeneic stem cell transplantation in some patients, especially elderly patients, represents unmet needs for advancing treatment for these challenging ALL cases.

Cellular immunotherapy with CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells has demonstrated encouraging results for the treatment of B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Currently used CAR T-cells are genetically engineered autologous T cells that express the antigen-binding domain linked to a costimulatory molecule and an intracellular T-cell receptor signaling domain. CAR T-cells function in a major histocompatibility complex-independent manner. Because of its expression on nearly all B-ALL, CD19 became the most sensible target. This paved the way for using tisagenlecleucel and brexucabtagene autoleucel in patients with B-ALL with astonishing outcomes4-6. However, the dependence on expression of the antigen of target can be an ""Achilles' heel"" for CAR T-cells similar to monoclonal antibodies, and loss of this target is a major escape mechanism by which cancer cells can evade immunotherapy. Mechanisms of antigenic loss may include genetic modulations, epitope masking, or a cell lineage switch with secondary loss of the target epitope7.

Cell plasticity is the ability of cells to be reprogrammed and to alter their fate and identity, which can enable homeostasis and restoration following injury. Pathological plasticity allows cancer cells to acquire new phenotypic and/or functional features leading to disease progression and resistance to therapy8. One of the most studied and established phenotypic and functional plasticity is KMT2A-r ALL9. The seminal work of Dr. John Dick and his lab in establishing the concept of leukemia stem cell was instrumental to the field. Transplantation of human ALL into NOD/SCID mice generates a disease in these mice that is reminiscent of the human disease10. The attributes of self-renewal and clonogenic proliferation are considered ""functional"" markers for stemness of these leukemia initiating cells. Because some of these functional assays are laborious, multiple efforts have been exerted to uncover the most accurate markers to label these cells that cab reliably predict this unique cellular population. In addition to cell-intrinsic factors for plasticity that are mentioned above, cell-extrinsic or ""niche"" elements can fuel cellular plasticity when they occur. Despite these limitations, CD34+CD38- cell fraction is most likely to harbor the most primitive and quiescent cells that can fuel disease existence11.

NCT06993753,Duration of Protection of Nirsevimab Against Hospitalisation for Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06993753,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of hospitalizations for acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in infants. In Australia approximately 1.5% of infants are hospitalized due to RSV, 80% of whom are born full-term and are otherwise healthy. Two randomized trials have used a seasonal implementation strategy to show nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, has sustained efficacy against RSV LRTI hospitalizations in the first 150-180 days after administration. Nirsevimab has been approved in many countries for the prevention of RSV-LRTI in neonates and infants. However, the protection offered by nirsevimab beyond 180 days remains unknown. Queensland is a large Australian state spanning the tropical and sub-tropical climate zones, where RSV circulates year-round. The Queensland government publicly funded nirsevimab for all infants at birth from 15 April 2024. The aim of this study is to estimate the duration of effectiveness of nirsevimab against RSV-related hospitalizations.

A case-control study will be conducted using routinely collected linked data. Cases will be children born in Queensland from 15 April 2024 to 14 April 2025 who are hospitalised with an RSV-related condition prior to 14 April 2026. Controls will be drawn from the set of infants who are admitted to the same hospital in a 5:1 ratio, and matched on age and sex using the Queensland Perinatal Data Collection. Nirsevimab receipt will be extracted from hospital's electronic medical records and linked to hospitalization data by the Queensland Health Data Linkage Unit. Duration of protection against RSV-related hospitalisation due to nirsevimab will be assessed using multivariable logistic regression model accounting for matching and adjusting for confounding variables.

This case-control study will determine the level and duration of protection offered by nirsevimab in a region with year-round RSV circulation and inform future prevention strategies. Interim analysis is expected to be available at the time of the conference, allowing for early dissemination of this first evidence about nirsevimab duration of protection beyond 180 days.

NCT06993727,Autoimmune Endocrine Disease Related Antibodies Before the Start of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06993727,,RECRUITING,"Promising treatments have been added to the oncologist's arsenal in recent years. Treatments that, unlike conventional chemotherapy, do not aim to destroy cancer cells directly, but rather activate the patient's own immune system to recognize and attack tumor cells again. This new treatment is called immune checkpoint therapy. This involves administering antibodies (large Y-shaped proteins that can stick to the surface of cells) that remove the brakes from the immune system.

The disadvantage of this innovative treatment is that the rejuvenated immune system can also attack cells that we want it not to recognize - our own body's cells. This is called autoimmunity. Patients who receive immune checkpoint therapy may suffer from symptoms such as skin rashes, diarrhea, hepatitis or hypothyroidism.

The purpose of this study is to find biomarkers predictive of the development of these side effects, and possibly also predict a better outcome of the cancer therapy.

Bispecific T-cell-based immunotherapies have the potential to promote further reduction of malignant plasma cells thus improving rates of MRD negativity and improve patient outcomes. In this study, participants who are MRD positive after front line therapy will receive consolidation with GPRC5D-targeted bispecific talquetamab. We will test MRD negative conversion and if MRD negativity was not achieved, the participant will switch to a different target using the B-cell maturation antigen TCE, teclistamab. Consolidation will be continued for up to 1 year in participants who have achieved MRD negativity.",NO,Multiple Myeloma,DRUG: Talquetamab|DRUG: Teclistamab,"Efficacy of Increasing the Rate of Minimal Residual Disease Negativity in Patients Who Have Been Newly Diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma, The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of using talquetamab as a consolidation treatment, either alone or followed by teclistamab, in increasing the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in patients who have been newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma.

The exact mechanisms behind this response remain a topic of extensive research, but it's clear that the body's reaction to the extracorporeal circulation, combined with surgical trauma, plays a significant role. Factors such as genomics, age, specific preoperative conditions, and the duration of operations have been associated with significant clinical responses.

A pivotal insight into this response comes from recent genome-wide transcriptional analyses. Perioperative ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) have been suggested as hub-nodes in a hierarchic structure evaluating the response to cardiac surgery. This suggests that IRI isn't just a side effect of the surgery but might be a central player in the body's inflammatory response.

Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. After MI, longterm antithrombotic therapy is crucial to prevent recurrent events, but increases bleeding, that also impacts morbidity and mortality. Giving these competing risks prediction tools to forecast ischemic and bleeding are of paramount importance to inform clinical decisions, but their current precision is limited. Improve events prediction, by discovering novel and innovative markers of risk would have a tremendous impact on therapeutic decisions and patients' outcome.

Objectives. Discover novel ""computational biomarkers"" of risk and improve current standards of risk prediction by using innovative multidimensional information from wearable devices, biomarkers, behavioural patterns and non-invasive imaging, integrated through artificial intelligence computation.

This study wants to learn how the physiological signals and movement data can help researchers understand and predict how children with neuromotor impairments engage with rehabilitation.

Who can take part? 40 participants between 5 and 17 years old will take part. Half of them will be children with neurotypical development (control). The other half will be children with neuromotor impairments.

What will happen in the study? Children within the control group will take part in 1 rehabilitation session, while those with neuromotor impairments will take part in 2 to 3 rehabilitation sessions as part of the treatment plan already provided by their referring physicians.

During each session, researchers will collect: (i) physiological signals like heart activity (ECG), heart rate variability (HRV), and electrodermal activity (EDA); (ii) movement data; (iii) exergames scores and motor performance data; (iv) questionnaires filled out by therapists to understand how engaged the participant is.

Children will use one of two technology-assisted rehabilitation systems during their sessions: either the Lokomat (robotic exoskeleton that supports children with impairments in walking) or the GRAIL system (a treadmill system with motion tracking and extended reality).

Why is this study important? Researchers will use the data to understand and predict how each child responds to therapy and engage with it.

It is composed of 10 items, divided into 3 sections. Section A (4 items) groups items exclusively related to the patient engagement evaluation, Section B (4 items) lists items exclusively devoted to therapists, Section C (2 items) contains items that evaluate the interaction between patient and therapist. Each item is proposed on a 5-points Likert scale, with minimum value 0 and maximum value 4. Higher values stand for higher engagement levels., Baseline","Service Provider-Rated Measure of Client Engagement (PRIME-SP), This measure is intended to capture the therapist's observation of patient engagement. PRIME-SP is a validated self-reported questionnaire that is composed of three main parts: Part A, where the therapist can perform an overall evaluation of patient engagement according to a 5-point Likert scale (from 0 to 4, with higher values corresponding to positive engagement); Part B, where the therapist can perform a domain-dependent (affective, cognitive, behavioral domains) evaluation of patient engagement according to a 5-point Likert scale (from 0 to 4, with higher values corresponding to positive engagement); Part C, where the therapist can take free notes about factors and circumstances that he/she believes may have affected patient engagement in the session., Baseline|Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM), The Self-Assessment Manikin is a self-reported questionnaire that evaluates the emotional valence, arousal, and dominance of the subject in relation to a specific context. It is composed of 3 items, namely valence, arousal, and dominance, to which the therapist has to answer according to its feelings regarding the participant's emotional state. Each item is measured through a 9-point Likert scale, from 1 to 9, where:

* valence: lower values stand for greater unpleasantness; higher values for higher pleasantness.
* arousal: lower values stand for lower affective activation; higher values for higher affective activation.
* dominance: lower values stand for lower control over the felt emotion; higher values for control over the felt emotion., Baseline|Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), PANAS is a self-reported questionnaire that is used to assess the positive and negative affective states. It is composed of two distinct scales: Positive Affect (PA) and Negative Affect (NA), with 20 items in total. Each item is structured with a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 to 5. The items are the following: interested, distressed, excited, upset, strong, guilty, scared, hostile, enthusiastic, proud, irritable, alert, ashamed, inspired, nervous, determined, attentive, jittery, active, and afraid. For each item, higher values on the Likert scale represent higher agreement with that specific word describing different feelings and emotions. Higer values for the items interested, excited, strong, enthusiastic, proud, alert, inspired, determined, attentive, active represent higher levels of affective engagement; conversely, higher values for the items distressed, upset, guilty, scared, hostile, irritable, ashamed, nervous, jittery, afraid represent lower levels of affective engagement., Baseline|Heart Rate (HR), It measures the number of heartbeats per minute. It is computed as the average number of R-peaks that occur within a minute. A moderately elevated HR may indicate physical or emotional engagement. Extremely high or low values might reflect discomfort or disengagement. A slightly increased HR, compared to rest condition, is generally interpreted as a positive sign of engagement during active tasks., Baseline|Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD), RMSSD is a measure of heart rate variability (HRV) that reflects short-term variations in the time between heartbeats. It is calculated as the square root of the mean squared differences between successive RR intervals (e.g., intervals between successive R-peaks). RMSSD is commonly associated with parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) activity. Higher RMSSD values are typically interpreted as positive, as they indicate a more regulated autonomic state and lower distress, potentially supporting better engagement., Baseline|Low Frequency power of Heart Rate Variability (HRV LF), HRV LF refers to the power of HRV in the low frequency range (typically 0.04-0.15 Hz). It is calculated using spectral analysis of RR intervals. Moderate LF values with respect to rest condition may suggest adaptive physiological arousal, but excessively high LF can reflect distress or discomfort., Baseline|High Frequency power of Heart Rate Variability (HRV HF), HRV HF is the high-frequency component of HRV (0.15-0.4 Hz), associated with parasympathetic nervous system activity and respiratory influences. It is calculated using spectral analysis of RR intervals. In the context of rehabilitation, higher HF values typically indicate calm, focused engagement and are thus seen as positive when participants are actively involved without distress., Baseline|Average Skin Conductance Level (AvSCL), AvSCL is the average level of the tonic (slow-changing) component of skin conductance over time. It reflects general autonomic arousal. It is calculated from electrodermal activity (EDA) after separating the tonic and phasic components as the mean value over time of the tonic component. Moderately higher AvSCL values suggest increased physiological arousal, which is typically positive if not excessive, as it indicates increased engagement into therapy., Baseline|Non-Specific Skin Conductance Responses (NSSCR), NSSCR represents the frequency of phasic skin conductance responses (rapid changes of skin conductance level, SCR) per minute. It is calculated by counting the number of over-threshold SCR peaks. A higher NSSCR generally indicates greater arousal and cognitive engagement and is considered a positive marker when aligned with task demands., Baseline|Low Frequency power of Skin Conductance Response (SCR LF), SCR LF measures the power of the skin conductance phasic signal in the low frequency band (0.045-0.15 Hz), focusing on slow oscillations in the phasic component. It is obtained using spectral analysis after SCR decomposition. An increased SCR LF may indicate sustained physiological activation and is generally interpreted as a positive indicator of cognitive and emotional engagement., Baseline|Walk Cadence, Walk Cadence is the number of steps a person takes per minute. It is calculated using inertial sensors placed on L5. Higher cadence typically reflects greater motor activation and is considered a positive outcome, especially when aligned with therapeutic goals., Baseline|Step Time, Step time is the average time taken to complete one step. It is calculated as the time between heel strikes of alternating feet. Lower step times (faster stepping) can reflect better motor coordination and task engagement. A decrease in step time, if associated with smooth and safe gait, is considered a positive sign of engagement and motor activation., Baseline|Exergame score, The exergame score represents the participant's performance level in gamified motor rehabilitation exercises. It is calculated from metrics such as task accuracy, reaction time, and completion rate, depending on the game design. Higher scores generally indicate better motor performance and sustained attention and are also interpreted as a positive measure of both physical and cognitive engagement during the session.

During Alzheimer's disease when cognitive disorders become too severe, language and communication are no longer present and/or mobilizable, and as a consequence there is a frequent discontinuation of Care and morever speech therapy rehabilitation. On this very specific subject of return to communication of patients suffering from very advanced Alzheimer's disease with cessation of communication, no data is currently avalable in the scientific literature to identify and define a ""threshold for return to communication"".

Objectives :

This study aims at obtaining a return to communication verbally (V) or non-verbally (NV), of patients living in nursing home suffering from severe neurocognitive disorders during Alzheimer disease using evaluation grids of V and NV communication.

Secondary objectives are the evaluation of recovery of a relationship with objects, quality of relashionship between patients and caregivers and family members , reduction in behavioral signs ( NPI-ES, EPADE survey), improved nutrition.

Method :

9 patients over 60 years old with major neurocognitive disorders at an advanced stage, presenting behavioral disorders, no longer communicating, interacting and having little or no relationship with objects, with stereotyped behavior or apathy living in 3 nursing home will be recruted during 36 months.

Each patient will receive a maximum of 34 weeks of Protologic and LAnguage adaptation rehabilitation by a speech therapist at a rate of one or two speech therapy sessions per week, for a total of 30 sessions maximum.

NCT06993194,Comparison of Haloperidol and Dexmedetomidine for Delirium and Agitation in ICU Patients With Traumatic Brain Injury,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06993194,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Traumatic brain injury is a serious and common medical condition that often requires admission to the intensive care unit and the use of mechanical ventilation. One of the most frequent and challenging complications in these patients is the development of delirium and agitation. These symptoms can prolong hospitalization, increase the risk of further brain injury, and complicate the medical and nursing care of the patient.

This interventional clinical trial is designed to compare the effects of two medications-haloperidol and dexmedetomidine-on the management of delirium and agitation in patients with traumatic brain injury admitted to the intensive care unit. Haloperidol is a traditional antipsychotic medication that is commonly used to manage agitation, but it may cause undesirable side effects such as movement disorders and disturbances in heart rhythm. Dexmedetomidine is a medication that acts on specific receptors in the nervous system to produce sedation and reduce agitation, and it is believed to cause fewer side effects related to breathing and movement.

The study will include forty adult patients with confirmed traumatic brain injury. These patients will be randomly assigned to receive either haloperidol or dexmedetomidine according to standard dosing guidelines. The study will evaluate and compare the following outcomes in both treatment groups: the presence and severity of delirium, the level of agitation, the total number of days the patient requires mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in the intensive care unit, the need for additional sedative medications, and the occurrence of any harmful effects from the study drugs.

To measure these outcomes, patients will be monitored using standardized tools that assess consciousness, agitation levels, and the presence of confusion. Additional medical examinations and laboratory tests will be conducted to ensure patient safety and collect relevant clinical data.

This study will be carried out in accordance with the ethical guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and will follow internationally accepted standards for research involving human participants. Approval has been granted by the appropriate medical ethics committee at the Faculty of Medicine, Benha University. Informed consent will be obtained from all patients or their legal representatives before participation.

NCT06993090,Efficacy of Dorsal Kinesio Tape Application for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in Esports Gamers: A Randomized Clinical Trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06993090,,COMPLETED,"This clinical trial investigates the effectiveness of Kinesio Tape (KT) in alleviating carpal tunnel-like symptoms and enhancing gaming performance among young adult PC gamers. The study aims to address two primary questions:

Does Kinesio Tape reduce wrist pain in adult PC gamers experiencing carpal tunnel-like symptoms?

Does Kinesio Tape improve gaming performance in this population?

Researchers will compare the effects of KT applied to the wrist versus the scapular spine to determine if wrist application provides greater pain relief and performance benefits.

Participants will undergo:

Screening \& Consent (Up to 30 minutes via Zoom): Informed consent and a Phalen's test to assess carpal tunnel-like symptoms.

Baseline (Day 0, 75 minutes): Completion of a demographic survey, 15 minutes of gaming on Kovaaks FPS Aim Trainer, KT application, 15 minutes of post-application gaming, and surveys (Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Severity \[BCSS\] and KT feedback).

Days 1 \& 2 (15 minutes each): KT removal and reapplication, followed by BCSS and KT feedback surveys.

Symptom severity was assessed using the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire - Symptom Severity Scale (BCTQ-SSS), a validated self-report measure. The BCTQ-SSS uses a 5-point Likert scale where 1 indicates no symptoms and 5 indicates very severe symptoms. Participants rated their symptoms at the end of each session to monitor changes across the intervention period. Higher scores reflect greater symptom burden. This measure was used to evaluate whether kinesiotape application reduced the severity of symptoms commonly associated with repetitive strain injuries in esports players., Administered at the end of each session on Day 0 (baseline), Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3 (post-intervention).

Participants completed two structured testing sessions-on Day 0 (baseline) and Day 3 (post-intervention)-each consisting of 15-minute gaming tasks both before and after kinesiotape application. The selected simulations targeted core esports competencies such as tracking (sustained aim on moving targets), flicking (rapid target shifts), and strafing (aiming while moving), which reflect real-world gaming demands. Performance data, including accuracy percentage and total score, were automatically recorded by the Kovaaks software and later averaged across trials to reduce variability. The purpose of this measure was to evaluate whether kinesiotape-applied to either the dorsal wrist or scapular spine, depending on group assignmet, Day 0 (baseline session) and Day 3 (post-intervention session). In both sessions, performance was measured twice - once before and once after kinesiotape application. Study sessions were conducted every other day over an 8-day period.",,"Perceived Effects of Kinesiotape (Custom Feedback Questionnaire and Thematic Analysis), This outcome captures participants' subjective perceptions of kinesiotape following each application session. A custom-designed feedback questionnaire was used to collect both quantitative Likert-scale ratings and open-ended qualitative responses. Quantitative items assessed sensations such as tightness, itchiness, and comfort, as well as perceived changes in speed, agility, and overall performance during gameplay. Open-ended responses allowed participants to describe in their own words how the tape influenced their motor control, posture, comfort, and focus. Thematic analysis was used to extract and categorize recurring themes across responses, including enhanced motor precision, ergonomic awareness, sensory experience, and psychological impact. Participants frequently reported improved wrist stability, increased awareness of movement patterns, postural corrections, and heightened confidence in gameplay execution.

Ten preschools (about 478 children) will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Five preschools (≈ 239 children) will continue with their usual educational activities (control group). The other five preschools (≈ 239 children) will take part in a six-month ""Social-HEROES"" programme (intervention group).

The intervention is created in participatory innovation labs where children, educators, families, community members and policy-makers design activities together, guided by a systems-thinking approach. These activities encourage healthier eating, more balanced 24-hour movement (active play, less sitting, better sleep) and stronger socio-emotional skills.

The study pursues two main goals. First, it will develop this innovative, stakeholder-driven health-promotion programme. Second, it will test how well the programme works by measuring: (a) children's health-literacy levels, (b) their lifestyle habits (diet, physical activity, sedentary time and sleep), (c) rates of overweight and obesity, and (d) blood-pressure levels.

Researchers expect that, compared with the control group, children in the intervention group will show higher health-literacy scores, healthier lifestyle patterns and lower rates of excess weight and raised blood pressure. Data will be collected before the programme starts and again six months later, using short questionnaires, simple body measurements, blood-pressure readings and a wrist-worn activity tracker (accelerometer) worn for seven days. Participation is voluntary, can be stopped at any time without penalty, and all information is handled in accordance with GDPR.

NCT06992934,Immunological Impact of a Post Cell Therapy Treatment With FLT3 Inhibitors,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06992934,TARGETALLO,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) is the only curative option for many hematological maligancies. The main cause of death following HSCT is the relapse of the original disease.

Few strategies have been developed to prevent relapse after bone marrow transplantation. New prophylactic strategies are needed to decrease the relapse incidence without increasing the non-relapse mortality in the post-transplant area. Several drugs are currently being explored as maintenance in several AML subgroups such as FLT3 ITD/mutated AML.

A specific group of AML patients display the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication (ITD) or mutation. These recurrent genetic abnormalities account for 30-35% of all AML patients. Because FLT3 is a tyrosine kinase, it can be targeted using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Originally limited to first generation sorafenib and Midostaurin, the FLT3 TKI now include second generation Gilteritinib, crenolanib and quizartinib13. Because many FLT3 AML patients would relapse after aHSCT, the use of sorafenib, the only FLT3 TKI available at that time, in a post-transplant setting started to be evaluated.

Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor that not only inhibit FLT3 but also the RAS, RAF, KIT, and the VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Several retrospective trials reported the safety and efficiency of a sorafenib maintenance.

In recent years, a mounting piece of evidence suggests that sorafenib may have an impact on several immune cells as T cell populations, dendritic cells, macrophages and myeloid-derived immunosuppressor cells (MDSC). Other more potent and more specific FLT3 inhibitors are currently under investigation both in combination with chemotherapy before transplantation and as post transplantation maintenance. In this line, crenolanib and Gilteritinib are two potent and more specific TKI that proved more effective than sorafenib in the treatment of FLT3 ITD/TKD relapsed, refractory AML patients. These drugs demonstrated a higher response rate in R/R patients. These two drugs are part of the future standard of care in FLT3 AML but their immunological impact has never been studied.

At a time where cellular therapies (allogeneic stem cell transplantation but also CAR T cells) and targeted therapies are becoming the central point of cancer treatment, it appears mandatory to better understand the interactions between the two. The goal of our research project which covers fundamental and clinical aspects of AML post-transplant treatments is devoted to a better understanding of the impact of Gilteritinib on the immune cells in order to rationalize their use after aHSCT. A better characterization of the action of these drugs on the immune system is urgently needed to develop new prophylactic strategies which could decrease the relapse incidence without increasing the non-relapse mortality in the post-transplant area. This program is proposed for a period of 3 years, time necessary to perform all the in vitro and ex vivo approaches and to recruit a sufficient number of patients eligible for aHSCT.",NO,Hematological Malignancies,DRUG: Gilteritinib,"Assess the off-target effects of Gilteritinib on the phenotype of immunity cells, Evaluation of the phenotype, At 3 months, 6 months, 1 year post maintenance start|Assess the off-target effects of Gilteritinib on the function of immunity cells, Evaluation of the phenotype, At 3 months, 6 months, 1 year post maintenance start|Assess the off-target effects of Gilteritinib on the metabolism of immunity cells, Evaluation of the phenotype, At 3 months, 6 months, 1 year post maintenance start","Overall survival after transplant, record of survival status, At 3 months post-transplant, 6 months, 1-year post|transplant relapse free survival, record of relapse event, At 3 months post-transplant, 6 months, 1-year post|aGVHD incidence, record of aGVHD event, At 3 months post-transplant, 6 months, 1-year post|cGVHD incidence, record of cGVHD event, At 3 months post-transplant, 6 months, 1-year post|Infection incidence, record of infection event, At 3 months post-transplant, 6 months, 1-year post",,Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,10,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,22-AOI-11,2025-06,2028-06,2028-06,2025-05-28,,2025-05-28,"CHU de NICE, Nice, France",
NCT06992921,Towards Personalized Nutrition With SCAPIS2-HOME,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06992921,,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"The Swedish CardioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) is a nationwide, open-access, population-based cohort in Sweden designed to study cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In January 2024, the reexamination of half of the cohort from SCAPIS1 started (the SCAPIS2). In SCAPIS2-HOME (a sub-study of SCAPIS2), individual responses to standardized isocaloric breakfasts and repeated Mixed Meal Tolerance Tests (MMTTs) will be investigated.

For this purpose, participants from the SCAPIS baseline cohort will be invited to take part in a 10-day intervention study, where participants will consume breakfast meals at clinic and the MMTTs at home. The breakfast meals will include ordinary cereal products that consist of either whole grain or refined grain foods served along with other typical breakfast items to be part of either a low-carbohydrate/high-fat or high-carbohydrate/low-fat breakfast. For the MMTTs, we will use standardized meal formulas called PhenFlex, which are high in calories, fat, and glucose and will be consumed repeatedly at home in the evening or the morning. Blood samples will be analyzed using clinical markers such as C-peptide, triglycerides, and markers of inflammation along with metabolomics. Continuous glucose monitoring will be used to obtain 24-hour interstitial glucose concentrations every 15 minutes during the 10-day intervention. Fecal- and blood samples will also be collected along with dietary assessments.

The research aims to understand the differential metabolic responses (glycemia, insulinemia, lipid profile, inflammation markers, and key metabolites) individuals may show after consuming whole grains or refined grains as part of breakfasts with high or low carbohydrate content. It is further to characterize to what extent an individual's specific characteristics, including the microbiota, health status, anthropometry, and habitual diet, drive such response differences.

These include anxiety, depression, and memory and thinking problems, caused by a combination of biological and psychological factors. They can be more disabling than physical symptoms, reduce quality of life and increase risk of mortality. They are also upsetting for family members and unpaid carers, and may necessitate transfer to institutional care. They also increase NHS costs because of expensive hospital admissions.

This study will address this by developing an effective programme of evidence-based psychological interventions for mental health issues in Parkinson's that can be easily delivered by non-experts.

1. Adjusting to diagnosis; empowering people to feel more in control.
2. Anxiety and/or depression; using cognitive-behavioural therapy techniques to improve mood, with particular focus on Parkinson's-specific concerns.
3. Advanced Parkinson's; helping people with Parkinson's and those around them to improve management of memory and thinking problems.

NCT06992830,Cardioneuroablation for Variant Angina,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06992830,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Variant angina, also known as vasospastic angina, is a form of chest pain caused by temporary spasms of the coronary arteries, which reduce blood flow to the heart. These spasms often occur at rest and may lead to serious complications, including life-threatening heart rhythm problems and sudden cardiac death. While most patients improve with medications such as calcium channel blockers and nitrates, some continue to have symptoms despite treatment. In addition, some patients are unable or unwilling to take medications regularly, which further limits effective management. These cases are referred to as medication-refractory or drug-intolerant variant angina.

The autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary functions like heart rate and blood vessel tone, is believed to play an important role in the development of coronary artery spasms. Recent research suggests that imbalances in autonomic activity, particularly excessive parasympathetic signals, may trigger these spasms.

Cardioneuroablation (CNA) is a minimally invasive procedure that uses a catheter to target specific nerve clusters called cardiac ganglionated plexi, located on the surface of the heart. These plexi are important centers of autonomic control and are mostly made up of parasympathetic nerve cells. Originally developed to treat conditions such as fainting spells and certain types of abnormal heart rhythms, CNA works by selectively reducing abnormal parasympathetic activity in the heart.

This study is designed to explore whether CNA can help relieve chest pain and reduce coronary spasms in patients with variant angina who do not respond to medications or cannot take them consistently. The study will evaluate the safety, practicality, and potential benefits of this approach as a new treatment option for a difficult-to-manage heart condition.",NO,Variant Angina,PROCEDURE: cardioneuroablation,"Change in Frequency of Coronary Spasm Episodes, The number of coronary spasm episodes will be recorded before and after the procedure using 24-hour Holter ECG and integrated dynamic ECG device.

* Control group: patients in this group will perform the exercises at home with the paretic upper limb wearing the orthosis (in order to stabilise the wrist and eliminate this potential confounding variable) but without the springs that provide resistance (i.e. eliminating the elastic resistance that is the subject of this study); Assignment to the treatment group will be based on a randomisation list (generated through https://www.random.org/ to obtain a balanced division) established by the Scientific Director of the study and communicated exclusively to the personnel involved in administering the treatment sessions, while it will not be disclosed to the personnel involved in the other phases of the study. This will allow for the division of patients and an evaluation of the effectiveness of the treatment between the two groups to be as objective as possible. At the end of the ten days of treatment, patients will return to the facilities of the UMR of the Ferrara University Hospital and repeat the assessments already carried out at baseline, in order to evaluate pre/post performance differences after the home treatment and the differences between the two groups. Finally, questionnaires will be administered to assess fatigue at the end of each day of treatment and patient satisfaction in relation to this telerehabilitation approach at the end of the ten days. It should be noted that patients allocated to the control group will be offered the opportunity to undergo the same treatment as the experimental group, i.e. using the orthosis, in order to ensure that all participants have an equal opportunity to benefit from the innovative protocol.

NCT06992674,The R-E-V-I-V-A-L Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06992674,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Vestibular migraine (VM) is one of the most common vestibular disorders, affecting 1.0% to 2.7% of the general population1, 7% of patients with definite migranous vertigo in dizziness clinics2, as well as 10.3% of VM patients in headache clinics3; 65% to 85% of VM patients are female1. Despite the relative prevalence of vestibular migraine, evidence-based medicine remains scarce. Two Cochrane reviews published in 2023 found that there is almost no evidence to support the use of medications for the acute treatment or preventive treatment of VM4,5.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been established as an excellent target for the treatment of migraine. Animal studies suggest a link between CGRP and vestibular disorders. A prospective observational cohort study found that monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP receptors and ligands were very effective for vestibular migraine (VM), with 90% of participants experiencing at least a 50% reduction in vertigo attacks6. A small-scale prospective randomized controlled trial showed that a monoclonal antibody targeting a CGRP ligand significantly reduced the number of dizziness days per month in VM patients compared to placebo7. The efficacy of CGRP small molecule antagonists for the preventive and acute treatment of migraines has been widely recognized8,9. Therefore, we speculate that Rimegepant is effective for the preventive and acute treatment of vestibular migraine.

By focusing on a large sample RCT, our study can offer new evidence-based treatment options for patients with vestibular migraine. This is crucial, as many patients with vestibular migraine may not respond well to conventional migraine treatments. Our findings could guide clinicians in choosing more effective therapeutic strategies.

Specifically in acute treatment of vestibular migraine, triptans have failed to show superiority when compared to placebo in treatment vestibular migraine symptoms10. Prochlorperazine, a vestibular sedative, is widely used for acute treatment of vestibular migraine but is known to chronify symptoms11.

The trial features comprehensive pharmacokinetic sampling through 15 timed blood collections over 24 hours and bronchoalveolar lavage at specified intervals (1h, 6h, 12h, or 24h post-dose) to characterize both systemic and pulmonary drug exposure. The study incorporates rigorous safety monitoring including adverse event tracking, vital sign measurements, and laboratory assessments over a 7-day observation period following drug administration. Conducted at Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Ruijin Hospital over a 12-month period (July 2025-July 2026), this investigation aims to establish the foundational pharmacokinetic parameters and safety profile of inhaled EGCG delivery in ILD patients while comparing pulmonary bioavailability against conventional oral administration.",NO,Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)|Healthy Volunteers,DRUG: ICF004 inhaled powder|DRUG: Oral Teavigo® capsules,"AUC0-24 hours of blood samples in ILD patients, AUC0-24 hours: Area Under the plasma concentration-time Curve from time zero to 24 hours post dose.

NCT06992609,Durvalumab After Chemoradiotherapy in Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06992609,ALBORAN,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Lung cancer is a highly prevalent disease worldwide in women and men. In 2022, lung cancer stood as the most frequently diagnosed cancer with approximately 2.48 million new cases on a global scale, followed by cancers of the female breast (11.6%), colorectum (9.6%), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (4.9%).

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide according to data provided by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. In 2022 they estimated a 1.8 million deaths across the world. Specifically in Spain, from 1980 to 2022, lung cancer led to 745,182 deaths.

Histologically, lung cancer (LC) can be classified into two major subtypes: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), accounting for 85% and 15% of LC patients, respectively. Smoking is the major risk factor for SCLC.

There are two stages of SCLC: limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC) and extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Limited-stage (LS) means that the cancer is located on the ipsilateral hemithorax that can be encompassed within a radiation port while extensive-stage (ES) means that the cancer has spread widely throughout the lungs, to non-regional lymph nodes or to other organs. At present, LS is identified in \~30% of patients, and ES is identified in \~70% of patients with SCLC.

With a 5-year survival rate of less than 7%, SCLC is still one of the most lethal malignancies and it is also characterized by early metastatic spread. Reflecting this high metastatic capacity, two thirds of patients already have tumor cell dissemination outside the chest at the time of initial diagnosis (ES-SCLC). Therefore, the number of patients with LS-SCLC who can benefit from multimodality therapy with potentially curative intent is limited. SCLC is a highly aggressive form of LC that typically recurs and progresses rapidly despite initial response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with LS-SCLC.

The etoposide/platinum (EP) combination was the standard of care (SoC) for patients with ES-SCLC until 2019, when the addition of immunotherapy to EP chemotherapy was shown to improve survival, with up to 17% of patients remaining alive at 3 years. On the other hand, the SoC for patients with LS-SCLC is concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) ± prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) that remained unchanged for decades. Several studies have shown that concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) is more effective than sequential CRT (sCRT) in LS-SCLC. Nonetheless, subject to the lymph node regions involvement and treatment-related toxicities, some patients do not undergo concurrent CRT and instead receive sequential CRT. In a non-interventional, retrospective cohort study of limited-stage SCLC patients conducted in France, Italy and the UK, sequential chemoradiotherapy accounts for 37.6% of all treatment patterns while concurrent chemoradiotherapy accounts for 35.1% of the whole therapies used as first line.

ADRIATIC (NCT03703297) is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, global study evaluating durvalumab ± tremelimumab as consolidation therapy for patients with LS-SCLC who have not progressed after cCRT. Positive high-level results of the ADRIATIC clinical trial showed durvalumab demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the dual primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with LS-SCLC who had not progressed following cCRT compared to placebo. Durvalumab was well tolerated, and AEs were consistent with the known safety profile. These data support the consolidation of durvalumab as a new SoC for patients with LS-SCLC who have not progressed after cCRT.

There is limited information on the effectiveness and safety of durvalumab in a broader patient population with LS-SCLC, including those who received sequential CRT.

Therefore, there remains an unmet need for additional data to help support and inform the healthcare decisions on the use of durvalumab as consolidation treatment for patients with LS-SCLC in real-world clinical practice. In addition, ADRIATIC study did not allow to include patients with ECOG PS 2 assessed after CRT.

NCT06992583,Targeted Anti-CEA CAR-T Immunotherapy for Advanced Lung Cancer,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06992583,,RECRUITING,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the world, of which 80%-85% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most patients with NSCLC are at the advanced stage of diagnosis and have a poor prognosis. The 5-year survival rate of stage III patients is about 15%, the 5-year survival rate of stage IV patients is less than 5%, and the median survival time is only 7 months.

CEACAM5 (CEA), also known as CD66e, is a classic tumor marker that has been used as a marker for many types of tumors for 50 years. It is mainly expressed in lung cancer, esophageal cancer, bile duct cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer and other tumor types.

The scientific name for this bacterium is Streptococcus pyogenes and it is commonly known as Strep A. Strep A is a common type of bacteria that can cause various infections. These range from skin infections and strep throat to more serious conditions like rheumatic heart disease. In recent years there has been an increase in severe Strep A infections in most countries. Many of these cases have been reported in the news.

Human challenge models are studies which allow researchers to study organisms that cause infections in humans. In this human challenge model study, healthy participants will be carefully exposed to a specific type of Strep A under controlled conditions to cause sore throat and learn more about how Strep A causes infection. The study team has already developed a safe human challenge model using a strain of Strep A called M75. This study will use a different strain of Strep A, called M1.

The main goal of this study is to check if the procedure is safe for participants and to understand how the participant's body responds to M1 Strep A. The study will explore:

1. How much M1 Strep A is required to cause an infection.
2. How M1 Strep A grows in the body.
3. How the body reacts to M1 Strep A.

The information the investigators will get about M1 Strep A from this study will help plan future research.
